              only a small fraction have been functionally characterized. Here
              we report a systematic analysis of the RNA motifs recognized by
              RNA-binding proteins, encompassing 205 distinct genes from 24
              diverse eukaryotes. The sequence specificities of RNA-binding
              proteins display deep evolutionary conservation, and the
              recognition preferences for a large fraction of metazoan
              RNA-binding proteins can thus be inferred from their RNA-binding
              domain sequence. The motifs that we identify in vitro correlate
              well with in vivo RNA-binding data. Moreover, we can associate
              them with distinct functional roles in diverse types of
              post-transcriptional regulation, enabling new insights into the
              functions of RNA-binding proteins both in normal physiology and in

              ability to extract biologically relevant information from the
              trained models. While there has been much recent work on
              developing feature attribution methods that discover the most

              between regulatory elements, which is the hallmark of phenomena

              activation of their target genes. A single enhancer, of a few
              hundred base pairs in length, can autonomously and independently
              of its location and orientation drive cell-type specific
              expression of a gene or transgene. It has been a long-standing
              goal in the field to decode the regulatory logic of an enhancer
              and to understand the details of how spatiotemporal gene
              expression is encoded in an enhancer sequence. Recently, deep
              learning models have yielded unprecedented insight into the
              enhancer code, and well-trained models are reaching a level of
              understanding that may be close to complete. As a consequence, we
              hypothesized that deep learning models can be used to guide the
              directed design of synthetic, cell type specific enhancers, and
              that this process would allow for a detailed tracing of all
              enhancer features at nucleotide-level resolution. Here we
              implemented and compared three different design strategies, each
              built on a deep learning model: (1) directed sequence evolution;
              (2) directed iterative motif implanting; and (3) generative
              design. We evaluated the function of fully synthetic enhancers to
              specifically target Kenyon cells in the fruit fly brain using
              transgenic animals. We then exploited this concept further by
              creating ``dual-code'' enhancers that target two cell types, and
              minimal enhancers smaller than 50 base pairs that are fully
              functional. By examining the trajectories followed during state
              space searches towards functional enhancers, we could accurately
              define the enhancer code as the optimal strength, combination, and
              relative distance of TF activator motifs, and the absence of TF
              repressor motifs. Finally, we applied the same three strategies to
              successfully design human enhancers. In conclusion, enhancer
              design guided by deep learning leads to better understanding of
              how enhancers work and shows that their code can be exploited to

              A powerful predictive model for the function of non-coding DNA can
              have enormous benefit for both basic science and translational
              research because over 98\% of the human genome is non-coding and
              93\% of disease-associated variants lie in these regions. To
              address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel hybrid convolutional

              research. Various DNA sequences should have a great variety of
              representations, and specific functions may focus on corresponding
              features in the front part of learning model. Currently, however,
              for multi-class prediction of non-coding DNA regulatory functions,
              most powerful predictive models do not have appropriate feature
              extraction and selection approaches for specific functional

              features and distinguish different DNA functions. In this study,
              we propose a hybrid deep neural network method, called DeepATT,

              type-specific binding of transcription factors (TFs) to regulatory
              elements. Identifying variants that disrupt TF binding and lead to
              human diseases remains a great challenge. To address this, we
              implement sequence-based deep learning models that accurately
              predict the TF binding intensities to given DNA sequences. In
              addition to accurately classifying TF-DNA binding or unbinding,
              our models are capable of accurately predicting real-valued TF
              binding intensities by leveraging large-scale TF ChIP-seq data.
              The changes in the TF binding intensities between the altered
              sequence and the reference sequence reflect the degree of
              functional impact for the variant. This enables us to develop the
              tool DeFine (Deep learning based Functional impact of non-coding

                   state-of-the-art neural networks. In this work, we study
                   rectifier neural networks for image classification from two
                   aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit
                   (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit.
                   PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra
                   computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we
                   derive a robust initialization method that particularly

              the fundamental problems in genome research. Gene regulatory code
              is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant
              semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often
              fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios. RESULTS: To
              address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained
              bidirectional encoder represen-tation, named DNABERT, to capture
              global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences
              based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared
              DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide
              regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use,
              accuracy, and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained
              transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art
              performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites, and
              transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using
              small task-specific labelled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct
              visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic
              relationship within input sequences for better interpretability
              and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and
              functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate
              that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily
              applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We
              anticipate that the pre-trained DNABERT model can be fined tuned

              with the emergence of Deep Learning as a set of powerful machine
              learning methods, has shifted the standard practices of machine
              learning for Genomics. Even though Deep Learning methods such as
              Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks
              (RNNs) are becoming widespread in Genomics, developing and
              training such models is outside the ability of most researchers in
              the field. RESULTS: Here we present ENNGene-Easy Neural Network
              model building tool for Genomics. This tool simplifies training of
              custom CNN or hybrid CNN-RNN models on genomic data via an
              easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. ENNGene allows multiple
              input branches, including sequence, evolutionary conservation, and
              secondary structure, and performs all the necessary preprocessing
              steps, allowing simple input such as genomic coordinates. The
              network architecture is selected and fully customized by the user,
              from the number and types of the layers to each layer's precise
              set-up. ENNGene then deals with all steps of training and
              evaluation of the model, exporting valuable metrics such as
              multi-class ROC and precision-recall curve plots or TensorBoard
              log files. To facilitate interpretation of the predicted results,
              we deploy Integrated Gradients, providing the user with a
              graphical representation of an attribution level of each input
              position. To showcase the usage of ENNGene, we train multiple
              models on the RBP24 dataset, quickly reaching the state of the art
              while improving the performance on more than half of the proteins
              by including the evolutionary conservation score and tuning the
              network per protein. CONCLUSIONS: As the role of DL in big data
              analysis in the near future is indisputable, it is important to
              make it available for a broader range of researchers. We believe
              that an easy-to-use tool such as ENNGene can allow Genomics
              researchers without a background in Computational Sciences to
              harness the power of DL to gain better insights into and extract

              transcription factor (TF) binding to expand the repertoire of
              binding models, replace low-quality models previously based on in
              vitro data only and cover more than a hundred TFs with previously
              unknown binding specificities. This was achieved by systematic
              motif discovery from more than five thousand ChIP-Seq experiments
              uniformly processed within the BioUML framework with several
              ChIP-Seq peak calling tools and aggregated in the GTRD database.
              HOCOMOCO v11 contains binding models for 453 mouse and 680 human

              promising strategy to ensure food security. However, such
              engineering is currently hindered by our limited knowledge of
              plant cis-regulatory elements. Here, we adapted self-transcribing
              active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq)-a technology for
              the high-throughput identification of enhancers-for its use in
              transiently transformed tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves. We
              demonstrate that the optimal placement in the reporter construct
              of enhancer sequences from a plant virus, pea (Pisum sativum) and
              wheat (Triticum aestivum), was just upstream of a minimal promoter
              and that none of these four known enhancers was active in the 3'
              untranslated region of the reporter gene. The optimized assay
              sensitively identified small DNA regions containing each of the
              four enhancers, including two whose activity was stimulated by
              light. Furthermore, we coupled the assay to saturation mutagenesis
              to pinpoint functional regions within an enhancer, which we
              recombined to create synthetic enhancers. Our results describe an
              approach to define enhancer properties that can be performed in
              potentially any plant species or tissue transformable by

              manner, making it a challenge to extract learned features that are
              biologically meaningful, such as sequence motifs. Here we perform
              a comprehensive analysis on synthetic sequences to investigate the
              role that CNN activations have on model interpretability. We show
              that employing an exponential activation to first layer filters

              gene expression in diverse cellular contexts are critical to
              decipher the dynamics of transcriptional regulation. Recently,
              convolutional neural networks have been used to learn predictive
              cis-regulatory DNA sequence models of context-specific chromatin
              accessibility landscapes. However, these context-specific
              regulatory sequence models cannot generalize predictions across
              cell types. RESULTS: We introduce multi-modal, residual neural
              network architectures that integrate cis-regulatory sequence and
              context-specific expression of trans-regulators to predict
              genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles across cellular
              contexts. We show that the average accessibility of a genomic
              region across training contexts can be a surprisingly powerful
              predictor. We leverage this feature and employ novel strategies
              for training models to enhance genome-wide prediction of shared
              and context-specific chromatin accessible sites across cell types.
              We interpret the models to reveal insights into cis- and

	abstract = {Abstract The first-layer filters employed in convolutional neural
              networks tend to learn, or extract, spatial features from the
              data. Within their application to genomic sequence data, these
              learned features are often visualized and interpreted by
              converting them to sequence logos; an information-based
              representation of the consensus nucleotide motif. The process to
              obtain such motifs, however, is done through post-training
              procedures which often discard the filter weights themselves and
              instead rely upon finding those sequences maximally correlated
              with the given filter. Moreover, the filters collectively learn
              motifs with high redundancy, often simply shifted representations
              of the same sequence. We propose a schema to learn sequence motifs
              directly through weight constraints and transformations such that
              the individual weights comprising the filter are directly
              interpretable as either position weight matrices (PWMs) or
              information gain matrices (IGMs). We additionally leverage
              regularization to encourage learning highly-representative motifs
              with low inter-filter redundancy. Through learning PWMs and IGMs
              directly we present preliminary results showcasing how our method
              is capable of incorporating previously-annotated database motifs

               have a significant impact on the cellular state and phenotype.
               However, sifting through the millions of candidate variants in a
               personal genome or a cancer genome, to identify those that impact
               cis-regulatory function, remains a major challenge.
               Interpretation of noncoding genome variation benefits from
               explainable artificial intelligence to predict and interpret the
               impact of a mutation on gene regulation. Here we generate phased
               whole genomes with matched chromatin accessibility, histone
               modifications, and gene expression for 10 melanoma cell lines. We
               find that training a specialized deep learning model, called
               DeepMEL2, on melanoma chromatin accessibility data can capture
               the various regulatory programs of the melanocytic and
               mesenchymal-like melanoma cell states. This model outperforms
               motif-based variant scoring, as well as more generic deep
               learning models. We detect hundreds to thousands of
               allele-specific chromatin accessibility variants (ASCAVs) in each
               melanoma genome, of which 15-20\% can be explained by gains or
               losses of transcription factor binding sites. A considerable
               fraction of ASCAVs are caused by changes in AP-1 binding, as
               confirmed by matched ChIP-seq data to identify allele-specific
               binding of JUN and FOSL1. Finally, by augmenting the DeepMEL2
               model with ChIP-seq data for GABPA, the TERT promoter mutation as
               well as additional ETS motif gains can be identified with high

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA regulation is significantly dependent on its
              binding protein partner, known as the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs).
              Unfortunately, the binding preferences for most RBPs are still not
              well characterized. Interdependencies between sequence and
              secondary structure specificities is challenging for both
              predicting RBP binding sites and accurate sequence and structure
              motifs detection. RESULTS: In this study, we propose a deep
              learning-based method, iDeepS, to simultaneously identify the
              binding sequence and structure motifs from RNA sequences using
              convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long
              short term memory network (BLSTM). We first perform one-hot
              encoding for both the sequence and predicted secondary structure,
              to enable subsequent convolution operations. To reveal the hidden
              binding knowledge from the observed sequences, the CNNs are
              applied to learn the abstract features. Considering the close
              relationship between sequence and predicted structures, we use the
              BLSTM to capture possible long range dependencies between binding
              sequence and structure motifs identified by the CNNs. Finally, the
              learned weighted representations are fed into a classification
              layer to predict the RBP binding sites. We evaluated iDeepS on
              verified RBP binding sites derived from large-scale representative
              CLIP-seq datasets. The results demonstrate that iDeepS can
              reliably predict the RBP binding sites on RNAs, and outperforms
              the state-of-the-art methods. An important advantage compared to
              other methods is that iDeepS can automatically extract both
              binding sequence and structure motifs, which will improve our
              understanding of the mechanisms of binding specificities of RBPs.
              CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the iDeepS method identifies the
              sequence and structure motifs to accurately predict RBP binding
              sites. iDeepS is available at https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS

	abstract = {The use of evolutionary profiles to predict protein secondary
              structure, as well as other protein structural features, has been
              standard practice since the 1990s. Using profiles in the input of
              such predictors, in place or in addition to the sequence itself,
              leads to significantly more accurate predictions. While profiles
              can enhance structural signals, their role remains somewhat
              surprising as proteins do not use profiles when folding in vivo.
              Furthermore, the same sequence-based redundancy reduction
              protocols initially derived to train and evaluate sequence-based
              predictors, have been applied to train and evaluate profile-based
              predictors. This can lead to unfair comparisons since profiles may
              facilitate the bleeding of information between training and test
              sets. Here we use the extensively studied problem of secondary
              structure prediction to better evaluate the role of profiles and
              show that: (1) high levels of profile similarity between training
              and test proteins are observed when using standard sequence-based
              redundancy protocols; (2) the gain in accuracy for profile-based
              predictors, over sequence-based predictors, strongly relies on
              these high levels of profile similarity between training and test
              proteins; and (3) the overall accuracy of a profile-based
              predictor on a given protein dataset provides a biased measure
              when trying to estimate the actual accuracy of the predictor, or
              when comparing it to other predictors. We show, however, that this
              bias can be mitigated by implementing a new protocol (EVALpro)
              which evaluates the accuracy of profile-based predictors as a
              function of the profile similarity between training and test
              proteins. Such a protocol not only allows for a fair comparison of
              the predictors on equally hard or easy examples, but also reduces
              the impact of choosing a given similarity cutoff when selecting
              test proteins. The EVALpro program is available in the SCRATCH

              sequence and structure motifs and the package offers an automated

              high-throughput means of characterizing the in vitro DNA-binding
              specificities of transcription factors (TFs). Using high-density,
              custom-designed microarrays containing all 10-mer sequence
              variants, one can obtain comprehensive binding-site measurements
              for any TF, regardless of its structural class or species of
              origin. Here, we present a protocol for the examination and
              analysis of TF-binding specificities at high resolution using such
              'all 10-mer' universal PBMs. This procedure involves
              double-stranding a commercially synthesized DNA oligonucleotide
              array, binding a TF directly to the double-stranded DNA microarray
              and labeling the protein-bound microarray with a
              fluorophore-conjugated antibody. We describe how to
              computationally extract the relative binding preferences of the
              examined TF for all possible contiguous and gapped 8-mers over the
              full range of affinities, from highest affinity sites to
              nonspecific sites. Multiple proteins can be tested in parallel in
              separate chambers on a single microarray, enabling the processing
              of a dozen or more TFs in a single day.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomly shuffled sequences are routinely used in
              sequence analysis to evaluate the statistical significance of a
              biological sequence. In many cases, biologists need sophisticated
              shuffling tools that preserve not only the counts of distinct
              letters but also higher-order statistics such as doublet counts,
              triplet counts, and, in general, k-let counts. RESULTS: We present
              a sequence analysis tool (named uShuffle) for generating uniform
              random permutations of biological sequences (such as DNAs, RNAs,
              and proteins) that preserve the exact k-let counts. The uShuffle
              tool implements the latest variant of the Euler algorithm and uses
              Wilson's algorithm in the crucial step of arborescence generation.
              It is carefully engineered and extremely efficient. The uShuffle
              tool achieves maximum flexibility by allowing arbitrary alphabet
              size and let size. It can be used as a command-line program, a web
              application, or a utility library. Source code in C, Java, and
              C\#, and integration instructions for Perl and Python are
              provided. CONCLUSION: The uShuffle tool surpasses existing
              implementation of the Euler algorithm in both performance and
              flexibility. It is a useful tool for the bioinformatics community.},

@article{Han2022-pi,
	abstract = {A critical problem in the field of post hoc explainability is
                   the lack of a common foundational goal among methods. For
                   example, some methods are motivated by function
                   approximation, some by game theoretic notions, and some by
                   obtaining clean visualizations. This fragmentation of goals
                   causes not only an inconsistent conceptual understanding of
                   explanations but also the practical challenge of not knowing
                   which method to use when. In this work, we begin to address
                   these challenges by unifying eight popular post hoc
                   explanation methods (LIME, C-LIME, KernelSHAP, Occlusion,
                   Vanilla Gradients, Gradients x Input, SmoothGrad, and
                   Integrated Gradients). We show that these methods all perform
                   local function approximation of the black-box model,
                   differing only in the neighbourhood and loss function used to
                   perform the approximation. This unification enables us to (1)
                   state a no free lunch theorem for explanation methods,
                   demonstrating that no method can perform optimally across all
                   neighbourhoods, and (2) provide a guiding principle to choose
                   among methods based on faithfulness to the black-box model.
                   We empirically validate these theoretical results using
                   various real-world datasets, model classes, and prediction
                   tasks. By bringing diverse explanation methods into a common
                   framework, this work (1) advances the conceptual
                   understanding of these methods, revealing their shared local
                   function approximation objective, properties, and relation to
                   one another, and (2) guides the use of these methods in

               post-translational modifications (PTMs) and how they affect
               DNA-templated processes at the molecular level. This
               understanding has been bolstered in the past decade by the
               identification of new types of histone PTM, the advent of new
               genome-wide mapping approaches and methods to deposit or remove
               PTMs in a locally and temporally controlled manner. Now, with
               the availability of vast amounts of data across various
               biological systems, the functional role of PTMs in important
               processes (such as transcription, recombination, replication,
               DNA repair and the modulation of genomic architecture) is slowly
               emerging. This Review explores the contribution of histone PTMs
               to the regulation of genome function by discussing when these
               modifications play a causative (or instructive) role in
               DNA-templated processes and when they are deposited as a
               consequence of such processes, to reinforce and record the
               event. Important advances in the field showing that histone PTMs
               can exert both direct and indirect effects on genome function

               Transcriptional regulation is typically mediated by distinct

	abstract = {Considerable progress towards an understanding of complex
              diseases has been made in recent years due to the development of
              high-throughput genotyping technologies. Using microarrays that
              contain millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
              Genome Wide Association Studies (GWASs) have identified SNPs that
              are associated with many complex diseases or traits. For example,
              as of February 2015, 2111 association studies have identified
              15,396 SNPs for various diseases and traits, with the number of
              identified SNP-disease/trait associations increasing rapidly in
              recent years. However, it has been difficult for researchers to
              understand disease risk from GWAS results. This is because most
              GWAS-identified SNPs are located in non-coding regions of the
              genome. It is important to consider that the GWAS-identified SNPs
              serve only as representatives for all SNPs in the same haplotype
              block, and it is equally likely that other SNPs in high linkage
              disequilibrium (LD) with the array-identified SNPs are causal for
              the disease. Because it was hoped that disease-associated coding
              variants would be identified if the true casual SNPs were known,
              investigators have expanded their analyses using LD calculation
              and fine-mapping. However, such analyses also identified
              risk-associated SNPs located in non-coding regions. Thus, the
              GWAS field has been left with the conundrum as to how a
              single-nucleotide change in a non-coding region could confer
              increased risk for a specific disease. One possible answer to
              this puzzle is that the variant SNPs cause changes in gene
              expression levels rather than causing changes in protein
              function. This review provides a description of (1) advances in

               historically been a valuable tool for identifying all different
               types of regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers,
               silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. This method
               utilizes DNase I to selectively digest nucleosome-depleted DNA

              conditions. Other downstream analyses are further needed to
              annotate cell states, extract pathway-level activity metrics,

              analytical requirements sequentially, lacking a cohesive
              framework to unify them. Moreover, these analyses are currently
              confined to specific modalities where the biological quantity of
              interest gives rise to a singular measurement. However, other
              modalities require joint consideration of dual measurements; for
              example, modeling the latent space of alternative splicing
              involves joint analysis of exon inclusion and exclusion reads.
              Here, we introduce a generative model, called GEDI, to identify
              latent space variations in multi-sample, multi-condition single
              cell datasets and attribute them to sample-level covariates. GEDI
              enables cross-sample cell state mapping on par with the

              learning-based prediction of sample characteristics from

              modifications, the binding of chromatin modifiers and
              transcription factors and cofactors, or chromatin accessibility.
              However, validating such candidates as bona fide enhancers
              requires functional characterization, typically achieved through
              reporter assays that test whether a sequence can increase
              expression of a transcriptional reporter via a minimal promoter.
              A longstanding concern is that reporter assays are mainly
              implemented on episomes, which are thought to lack physiological
              chromatin. However, the magnitude and determinants of differences
              in cis-regulation for regulatory sequences residing in episomes
              versus chromosomes remain almost completely unknown. To address
              this systematically, we developed and applied a novel
              lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA) to
              directly compare the functional activities of 2236 candidate
              liver enhancers in an episomal versus a chromosomally integrated
              context. We find that the activities of chromosomally integrated
              sequences are substantially different from the activities of the
              identical sequences assayed on episomes, and furthermore are
              correlated with different subsets of ENCODE annotations. The
              results of chromosomally based reporter assays are also more
              reproducible and more strongly predictable by both ENCODE
              annotations and sequence-based models. With a linear model that
              combines chromatin annotations and sequence information, we
              achieve a Pearson's R2 of 0.362 for predicting the results of
              chromosomally integrated reporter assays. This level of
              prediction is better than with either chromatin annotations or
              sequence information alone and also outperforms predictive models
              of episomal assays. Our results have broad implications for how

               (CUT\&RUN), a chromatin profiling strategy in which
               antibody-targeted controlled cleavage by micrococcal nuclease
               releases specific protein-DNA complexes into the supernatant for
               paired-end DNA sequencing. Unlike Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
               (ChIP), which fragments and solubilizes total chromatin,
               CUT\&RUN is performed in situ, allowing for both quantitative
               high-resolution chromatin mapping and probing of the local
               chromatin environment. When applied to yeast and human nuclei,
               CUT\&RUN yielded precise transcription factor profiles while
               avoiding crosslinking and solubilization issues. CUT\&RUN is
               simple to perform and is inherently robust, with extremely low
               backgrounds requiring only ~1/10th the sequencing depth as ChIP,
               making CUT\&RUN especially cost-effective for transcription
               factor and chromatin profiling. When used in conjunction with
               native ChIP-seq and applied to human CTCF, CUT\&RUN mapped
               directional long range contact sites at high resolution. We
               conclude that in situ mapping of protein-DNA interactions by
               CUT\&RUN is an attractive alternative to ChIP-seq.},

              Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently gained popularity in

               limitation that if the parameter k is increased to resolve
               longer features, the probability of observing any specific k-mer
               becomes very small, and k-mer counts approach a binary variable,
               with most k-mers absent and a few present once. Thus, any
               statistical learning approach using k-mers as features becomes
               susceptible to noisy training set k-mer frequencies once k
               becomes large. To address this problem, we introduce alternative
               feature sets using gapped k-mers, a new classifier, gkm-SVM, and
               a general method for robust estimation of k-mer frequencies. To
               make the method applicable to large-scale genome wide

              evolution of such cis-regulatory elements is a major source of
              adaptive evolution; however, the regulatory and evolutionary
              potential of such elements remains little understood, masked by

              observed that most mutations in classical developmental enhancers
              led to changes in gene expression levels but rarely resulted in
              novel expression outside of the native cell- and tissue-types. In

              cell-types, in patterns consistent with transcription factor
              motifs therein; random sequences including motifs for
              transcription factors with pioneer activity acted as enhancers
              even more frequently and resulting in higher levels of
              expression. Together, our findings suggest that the adaptive
              phenotypic landscapes of developmental enhancers are constrained

              propose that the evolution of existing enhancers is limited in

               mechanism involving the transfer of a methyl group onto the C5
               position of the cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine. DNA
               methylation regulates gene expression by recruiting proteins
               involved in gene repression or by inhibiting the binding of
               transcription factor(s) to DNA. During development, the pattern
               of DNA methylation in the genome changes as a result of a
               dynamic process involving both de novo DNA methylation and
               demethylation. As a consequence, differentiated cells develop a
               stable and unique DNA methylation pattern that regulates
               tissue-specific gene transcription. In this chapter, we will
               review the process of DNA methylation and demethylation in the
               nervous system. We will describe the DNA (de)methylation
               machinery and its association with other epigenetic mechanisms
               such as histone modifications and noncoding RNAs. Intriguingly,
               postmitotic neurons still express DNA methyltransferases and
               components involved in DNA demethylation. Moreover, neuronal
               activity can modulate their pattern of DNA methylation in
               response to physiological and environmental stimuli. The precise
               regulation of DNA methylation is essential for normal cognitive

               require the mapping of specific chromatin features in small

               Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT\&Tag), an enzyme-tethering
               strategy that provides efficient high-resolution sequencing
               libraries for profiling diverse chromatin components. In
               CUT\&Tag, a chromatin protein is bound in situ by a specific
               antibody, which then tethers a protein A-Tn5 transposase fusion
               protein. Activation of the transposase efficiently generates
               fragment libraries with high resolution and exceptionally low

              innovations in deep neural network modeling of CRE activity

              massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to design and

               receptors, cell adhesion molecules, motor proteins, signaling
               molecules and many others. Collectively such genes have been
               referred to as ``terminal differentiation genes'' or ``effector

               sequences. Recent genomic studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have
               revealed that many endogenous genes are methylated either within

               However, plants have different types of methylation controlled
               by different genetic pathways, and detailed information on the
               methylation status of each cytosine in any given genome is

               requires precise genome editing technologies. The type II
               prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short
               palindromic repeats)/Cas adaptive immune system has been shown
               to facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage. We
               engineered two different type II CRISPR/Cas systems and
               demonstrate that Cas9 nucleases can be directed by short RNAs to
               induce precise cleavage at endogenous genomic loci in human and
               mouse cells. Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to
               facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic
               activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a
               single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several
               sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy
               programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided

               datasets of ever-increasing size and complexity have been
               produced using experimental techniques based on high-throughput
               sequencing. In particular, the study of the 3D organization of
               chromatin has raised increasing interest, thanks to the
               development of advanced experimental techniques. In this
               context, Hi-C has been widely adopted as a high-throughput
               method to measure pairwise contacts between virtually any pair
               of genomic loci, thus yielding unprecedented challenges for
               analyzing and handling the resulting complex datasets. In this
               review, we focus on the increasing complexity of available Hi-C
               datasets, which parallels the adoption of novel protocol
               variants. We also review the complexity of the multiple data
               analysis steps required to preprocess Hi-C sequencing reads and
               extract biologically meaningful information. Finally, we discuss

              each gene is transcribed in a given genome and cellular state
              remains a central goal of biology. Here, we discuss major layers
              of regulation that influence how transcriptional outputs are
              encoded by DNA sequence and cellular context. We first discuss
              how transcription factors bind specific DNA sequences in a
              dosage-dependent and cooperative manner and then proceed to the
              cofactors that facilitate transcription factor function and
              mediate the activity of modular cis-regulatory elements such as
              enhancers, silencers, and promoters. We then consider the complex
              and poorly understood interplay of these diverse elements within
              regulatory landscapes and its relationships with chromatin states
              and nuclear organization. We propose that a mechanistically
              informed, quantitative model of transcriptional regulation that
              integrates these multiple regulatory layers will be the key to
              ultimately cracking the cis-regulatory code.},
