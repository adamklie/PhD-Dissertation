              intestinalis and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs),
              that single nucleotide changes can optimize the affinity of ETS

              associated with heart phenotypes. In Ciona, ETS
              affinity-optimizing SNVs lead to ectopic expression and phenotypic
              changes including two beating hearts. In human iPSC-CMs, an
              affinity-optimizing SNV associated with QRS duration occurs within
              an SCN5A enhancer and leads to increased enhancer activity. Our

              impacts heart development.Highlights ETS affinity-optimizing SNVs

              and how much genes should be expressed - has proven to be
              exceedingly complex. Recently, advances in the scale and
              resolution of functional genomics assays and machine learning have
              enabled substantial progress towards deciphering this code.
              However, the cis-regulatory code will probably never be solved if

              critical tools in deciphering the roles of genomic sequences and
              genetic variation within them. However, traditional approaches for
              dividing the genomic sequences into training data, used to create
              the model, and test data, used to determine the model’s
              performance on unseen data, fail to account for the widespread
              homology that permeates the genome. Using models that predict
              human gene expression from DNA sequence, we demonstrate that model
              performance on test sequences varies by their similarity with
              training sequences, consistent with homology-based ‘data leakage’
              that influences model performance by rewarding overfitting of

              increase model performance by providing improved splits for model

              genes on and off in response to a variety of intrinsic and
              extrinsic signals. Despite the discovery of the first enhancer
              more than 30 y ago, the relationship between primary DNA sequence
              and enhancer activity remains obscure. In particular, the
              importance of ``syntax'' (the order, orientation, and spacing of
              binding sites) is unclear. A high-throughput screen identified
              synthetic notochord enhancers that are activated by the
              combination of ZicL and ETS transcription factors in Ciona
              embryos. Manipulation of these enhancers elucidated a ``regulatory
              code'' of sequence and syntax features for notochord-specific
              expression. This code enabled in silico discovery of bona fide
              notochord enhancers, including those containing low-affinity
              binding sites that would be excluded by standard motif
              identification methods. One of the newly identified enhancers maps
              upstream of the known enhancer that regulates Brachyury (Ci-Bra),
              a key determinant of notochord specification. This newly
              identified Ci-Bra shadow enhancer contains binding sites with very
              low affinity, but optimal syntax, and therefore mediates
              surprisingly strong expression in the notochord. Weak binding
              sites are compensated by optimal syntax, whereas enhancers
              containing high-affinity binding affinities possess suboptimal
              syntax. We suggest this balance has obscured the importance of
              regulatory syntax, as noncanonical binding motifs are typically
              disregarded by enhancer detection methods. As a result, enhancers
              with low binding affinities but optimal syntax may be a vastly
              underappreciated feature of the regulatory genome.",

              Pinpointing which enhancer variants contribute to changes in gene
              expression and phenotypes is a major challenge. Here, we find that
              suboptimal or low-affinity binding sites are necessary for precise
              gene expression during heart development. Single-nucleotide
              variants (SNVs) can optimize the affinity of ETS binding sites,
              causing gain-of-function (GOF) gene expression, cell migration
              defects, and phenotypes as severe as extra beating hearts in the
              marine chordate Ciona robusta. In human induced pluripotent stem
              cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes, a SNV within a human GATA4
              enhancer increases ETS binding affinity and causes GOF enhancer
              activity. The prevalence of suboptimal-affinity sites within
              enhancers creates a vulnerability whereby affinity-optimizing SNVs
              can lead to GOF gene expression, changes in cellular identity, and
              organismal-level phenotypes that could contribute to the evolution
              of novel traits or diseases.",

              mesendoderm, but less is known about the ectoderm, giving rise to

              surprisingly places the maternal transcription factor Ci-GATAa
              (GATA4/5/6) at the top of the ectodermal regulatory network in
              ascidians. Initially distributed throughout the embryo, Ci-GATAa
              activity is progressively repressed in vegetal territories by
              accumulating maternal beta-catenin. Once restricted to the animal
              hemisphere, Ci-GATAa directly activates two types of zygotic
              ectodermal genes. First, Ci-fog is activated from the 8-cell stage

              cis-regulatory modules. Although these modules are usually made of
              clusters of short transcription factor binding sites, a small
              minority of such clusters in the genome have cis-regulatory
              activity. This paradox is currently unsolved. RESULTS: To identify
              what discriminates active from inactive clusters, we focused our
              attention on short topologically unconstrained clusters of two ETS
              and two GATA binding sites, similar to the early neural enhancer
              of Ciona intestinalis Otx. We first computationally identified 55
              such clusters, conserved between the two Ciona genomes. In vivo
              assay of the activity of 19 hits identified three novel early
              neural enhancers, all located next to genes coexpressed with Otx.
              Optimization of ETS and GATA binding sites was not always
              sufficient to confer activity to inactive clusters. Rather, a
              dinucleotide sequence code associated to nucleosome depletion
              showed a robust correlation with enhancer potential.
              Identification of a large collection of Ciona regulatory regions
              revealed that predicted nucleosome depletion constitutes a general
              signature of Ciona enhancers, which is conserved between
              orthologous loci in the two Ciona genomes and which partitions
              conserved noncoding sequences into a major nucleosome-bound
              fraction and a minor nucleosome-free fraction with higher
              cis-regulatory potential. We also found this signature in a large
              fraction of short Drosophila cis-regulatory modules. CONCLUSION:
              This study indicates that a sequence-based dinucleotide signature,
              previously associated with nucleosome depletion and independent of
              transcription factor binding sites, contributes to the definition
              of a local cis-regulatory potential in two metazoa, Ciona
              intestinalis and Drosophila melanogaster.",

              sequence to control gene expression remains unclear, largely
              because past studies using native and engineered sequences had
              insufficient scale. Here, we measure the expression output of >100
              million synthetic yeast promoter sequences that are fully random.
              These sequences yield diverse, reproducible expression levels that
              can be explained by their chance inclusion of functional TF
              binding sites. We use machine learning to build interpretable
              models of transcriptional regulation that predict ~94\% of the
              expression driven from independent test promoters and ~89\% of the
              expression driven from native yeast promoter fragments. These
              models allow us to characterize each TF's specificity, activity
              and interactions with chromatin. TF activity depends on
              binding-site strand, position, DNA helical face and chromatin
              context. Notably, expression level is influenced by weak
              regulatory interactions, which confound designed-sequence studies.

              correlations in DNA sequence elements can be described, but the
              frequency of observing any specific k-mer becomes very small, and
              rapidly approaches a sparse matrix of binary counts. Thus any

               to tunicates. Despite their critical importance for understanding
               the origins of vertebrates, phylogenetic studies of chordate
               relationships have provided equivocal results. Taking advantage
               of the genome sequencing of the appendicularian Oikopleura
               dioica, we assembled a phylogenomic data set of 146 nuclear genes
               (33,800 unambiguously aligned amino acids) from 14 deuterostomes
               and 24 other slowly evolving species as an outgroup. Here we show
               that phylogenetic analyses of this data set provide compelling
               evidence that tunicates, and not cephalochordates, represent the
               closest living relatives of vertebrates. Chordate monophyly
               remains uncertain because cephalochordates, albeit with a
               non-significant statistical support, surprisingly grouped with
               echinoderms, a hypothesis that needs to be tested with additional
               data. This new phylogenetic scheme prompts a reappraisal of both
               morphological and palaeontological data and has important
               implications for the interpretation of developmental and genomic
               studies in which tunicates and cephalochordates are used as model
               animals.",

              learning represents one emerging strategy to model the regulatory
              grammar that relates CRE sequence to function. However, these
              models require training data on a scale that exceeds the number of
              CREs in the genome. We address this problem using active machine
              learning to iteratively train models on multiple rounds of
              synthetic DNA sequences assayed in live mammalian retinas. During
              each round of training the model actively selects sequence
              perturbations to assay, thereby efficiently generating informative
              training data. We iteratively trained a model that predicts the
              activities of sequences containing binding motifs for the
              photoreceptor transcription factor Cone-rod homeobox (CRX) using
              an order of magnitude less training data than current approaches.
              The model's internal confidence estimates of its predictions are
              reliable guides for designing sequences with high activity. The
              model correctly identified critical sequence differences between

              factor binding sites, and revealed order and spacing preferences

              as an effective method to train accurate deep learning models of

              cell-state specific enhancers in the context of the
              differentiation of blood stem cells to seven myeloid lineages.
              Focusing on binding sites for 38 TFs and their pairwise
              interactions, we found that identical sites displayed both
              repressive and activating function, as a consequence of cellular
              context, site combinatorics, or simply predicted occupancy of a TF
              on an enhancer. Surprisingly, we found that combinations of
              activating sites frequently neutralized each other or even gained
              repressive function. These negative synergies convert quantitative
              imbalances in transcription factor expression into binary

               the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation
