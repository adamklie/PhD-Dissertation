Genes are regulated by interactions with multiple transcription factors and the target sites for the transcription factors required for the control of each gene constitute its cis-regulatory system. These systems are remarkably complex. Their hardwired internal organization enables them to behave as genomic information processing systems. Developmental gene regulatory networks consist of the cis-regulatory systems of all the relevant genes and the regulatory linkages amongst them. Though there is yet little explicit information, some general properties of genomic regulatory networks have become apparent. The key to understanding how genomic regulatory networks are organized, and how they work, lies in experimental analysis of cis-regulatory systems at all levels of the regulatory network.},

Basic data stewardship is still taught relatively rarely in life science education programmes, creating a chasm between theory and practice, and fuelling demand for bioinformatics training across all educational levels and career roles. Concerned by this, surveys have been conducted in recent years to monitor bioinformatics and computational training needs worldwide. This article briefly reviews the principal findings of a number of these studies. We see that there is still a strong appetite for short courses to improve expertise and confidence in data analysis and interpretation; strikingly, however, the most urgent appeal is for bioinformatics to be woven into the fabric of life science degree programmes. Satisfying the relentless training needs of current and future generations of life scientists will require a concerted response from stakeholders across the globe, who need to deliver sustainable solutions capable of both transforming education curricula and cultivating a new cadre of trainer scientists.},

It is a rod-like mesodermal structure that runs the anterior\textendash posterior length of the embryo, adjacent to the ventral neural tube. The notochord plays a critical role in embryonic tissue patterning, for example the dorsal\textendash ventral patterning of the neural tube. The cells that will come to form the notochord are specified at gastrulation. Axial mesodermal cells arising at the anterior primitive streak migrate anteriorly as the precursors of the notochord and populate the notochordal plate. Yet, even though a lot of interest has centered on investigating the functional and structural roles of the notochord, we still have a very rudimentary understanding of notochord morphogenesis. The events driving the formation of the notochord are rapid, taking place over the period of approximately a day in mice. In this commentary, we provide an overview of our current understanding of mouse notochord morphogenesis, from the initial specification of axial mesendodermal cells at the primitive streak, the emergence of these cells at the midline on the surface of the embryo, to their submergence and organization of the stereotypically positioned notochord.

The best understood type of DNA sequence, which was also the first to be discovered, is that which encodes RNA and protein products via the near-universal ``genetic code'' (1). A more mysterious but equally important class of functional DNA is cis- regulatory sequence, which does not have a physical product but, instead, encodes the conditions under which a particular RNA will be produced. Cis -regulatory DNA sequences are the primary (although not the only) determinant of gene expression: Not only the rate of RNA production but also the timing, spatial patterning, and environmental control of every gene's activity are largely controlled by these DNA sequences, which are usually in the general vicinity of the gene they regulate. These DNA segments (often called enhancers) have no enzymatic activity on their own, but act as scaffolds for large complexes of proteins and RNAs that directly control the activity of a gene's promoter, sometimes over distances of 1 million base pairs or more (2). Transcription factors (TFs), key protein regulators of gene expression, bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner, which means that the nature of the complex assembled at a given enhancer at a given time depends on its DNA sequence ( cis information), in conjunction with the set of TFs present and active in the cell \ldots{}  [{$\carriagereturn$}][1]1Email: sbarolo\{at\}umich.edu.

Divergence in gene expression due to cis-regulatory variants in noncoding regions is central to disease susceptibility. We show that integrative computational analysis of phylogenetic conservation with a complexity assessment of co-occurring transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) can identify cis-regulatory variants and elucidate their mechanistic role in disease. Analysis of established type 2 diabetes risk loci revealed a striking clustering of distinct homeo-box TFBS. We identified the PRRX1 homeobox factor as a repressor of PPARG2 expression in adipose cells and demonstrate its adverse effect on lipid metabolism and systemic insulin sensitivity, dependent on the rs4684847 risk allele that triggers PRRX1 binding. Thus, cross-species conservation analysis at the level of co-occurring TFBS provides a valuable contribution to the translation of genetic association signals to disease-related molecular mechanisms.},

In vertebrates, the notochord arises from the dorsal organizer and it is critical for proper vertebrate development. This evolutionary conserved structure located at the developing midline defines the primitive axis of embryos and represents the structural element essential for locomotion. Besides its primary structural function, the notochord is also a source of developmental signals that patterns surrounding tissues. Among the signals secreted by the notochord, Hedgehog proteins play key roles during embryogenesis. The Hedgehog signaling pathway is a central regulator of embryonic development, controlling the patterning and proliferation of a wide variety of organs. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on notochord structure and functions, with a particular emphasis on the key developmental events that take place in vertebrates. Moreover, we discuss some genetic studies highlighting the phenotypic consequences of impaired notochord development, which enabled to understand the molecular basis of different human congenital defects and diseases.},

Ciona has a small genome, and simple, well-defined embyronic lineages. Here, we examine the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differentiation of the notochord. Particular efforts center on the regulation of a notochord-specific Ciona Brachyury gene (Ci-Bra). An electroporation method was devised for the efficient incorporation of transgenic DNA into Ciona embryos. This method permitted the identification of a minimal, 434 bp enhancer from the Ci-Bra promoter region that mediates the notochord-restricted expression of both GFP and lacZ reporter genes. This enhancer contains a negative control region that excludes Ci-Bra expression from inappropriate embryonic lineages, including the trunk mesenchyme and tail muscles. Evidence is presented that the enhancer is activated by a regulatory element which is closely related to the recognition sequence of the Suppressor of Hairless transcription factor, thereby raising the possibility that the Notch signaling pathway plays a role in notochord differentiation. We discuss the implications of this analysis with regard to the evolutionary conservation of integrative enhancers, and the subdivision of the axial and paraxial mesoderm in vertebrates.},

Here, we measure the expression output of {$>$}100 million synthetic yeast promoter sequences that are fully random. These sequences yield diverse, reproducible expression levels that can be explained by their chance inclusion of functional TF binding sites. We use machine learning to build interpretable models of transcriptional regulation that predict \textasciitilde 94\% of the expression driven from independent test promoters and \textasciitilde 89\% of the expression driven from native yeast promoter fragments. These models allow us to characterize each TF's specificity, activity and interactions with chromatin. TF activity depends on binding-site strand, position, DNA helical face and chromatin context. Notably, expression level is influenced by weak regulatory interactions, which confound designed-sequence studies. Our analyses show that massive-throughput assays of fully random DNA can provide the big data necessary to develop complex, predictive models of gene regulation.},

  abstract = {The notochord is a major regulator of embryonic patterning in vertebrates and abnormal notochordal development is associated with a variety of birth defects in man. Proper knowledge of the development of the human notochord, therefore, is important to understand the pathogenesis of these birth defects. Textbook descriptions vary significantly and seem to be derived from both human and animal data whereas the lack of references hampers verification of the presented data. Therefore, a verifiable and comprehensive description of the development of the human notochord is needed. Our analysis and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of 27 sectioned human embryos ranging from Carnegie Stage 8 to 15 (17\textendash 41 days of development), resulted in a comprehensive and verifiable new model of notochordal development. Subsequent to gastrulation, a transient group of cells briefly persists as the notochordal process which is incorporated into the endodermal roof of the gut while its dorsal side attaches to the developing neural tube. Then, the notochordal process embeds entirely into the endoderm, forming the epithelial notochordal plate, which remains intimately associated with the neural tube. Subsequently, the notochordal cells detach from the endoderm to form the definitive notochord, allowing the paired dorsal aortae to fuse between the notochord and the gut. We show that the formation of the notochordal process and plate proceeds in cranio-caudal direction. Moreover, in contrast to descriptions in the modern textbooks, we report that the formation of the definitive notochord in humans starts in the middle of the embryo, and proceeds in both cranial and caudal directions.},

The modern ascidian tadpole represents a plausible approximation to these ancestral chordates. To illuminate the origins of chordate and vertebrates, we generated a draft of the protein-coding portion of the genome of the most studied ascidian, Ciona intestinalis. The Ciona genome contains approximately 16,000 protein-coding genes, similar to the number in other invertebrates, but only half that found in vertebrates. Vertebrate gene families are typically found in simplified form in Ciona, suggesting that ascidians contain the basic ancestral complement of genes involved in cell signaling and development. The ascidian genome has also acquired a number of lineage-specific innovations, including a group of genes engaged in cellulose metabolism that are related to those in bacteria and fungi.},

  abstract = {Brachyury is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator that is essential for notochord differentiation in a variety of chordates. In vertebrates, Brachyury is expressed throughout the presumptive mesoderm, but becomes restricted to the notochord at later stages of development. In ascidians, such as Ciona intestinalis, Brachyury is expressed exclusively in the notochord and does not exhibit an early pan-mesodermal pattern. Subtractive hybridization screens were recently used to identify potential Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) target genes (Takahashi, H., Hotta, K., Erives, A., Di Gregorio, A., Zeller, R. W., Levine, M. and Satoh, N. (1999). Genes Dev. 13, 1519\textendash 1523). Of the genes that were identified in this screen, one corresponds to a new member of the tropomyosin superfamily, Ciona tropomyosin (Ci-trop). Here we show that Ci-trop is specifically expressed in the developing notochord beginning at gastrulation, and expression persists in the notochord during tailbud and tadpole stages. A 3 kb region of the Ci-trop 5{${'}$}-flanking sequence was characterized via electroporation of lacZ fusion genes into fertilized Ciona eggs. A minimal, 114 bp enhancer was identified that is sufficient to direct the expression of a heterologous promoter in the notochord. DNA binding assays indicate that this enhancer contains two sets of low-affinity Brachyury half-sites, which are bound in vitro by a GST/Ci-Bra fusion protein. Deletion of the distal sites inactivates the notochord-specific staining pattern mediated by an otherwise normal Ci-trop/lacZ transgene. These results suggest that Ci-trop is a direct target gene of Ci-Bra and that Brachyury plays an immediate role in the cellular morphogenesis of the notochord.},

  abstract = {For gene enhancers, less is more Weak enhancer sequences provide just the right amount of gene activity. Farley et al. systematically examined millions of synthetic variants of the Otx enhancer, a motif needed for gene expression in the nervous system of the sea squirt Ciona. Proper gene activity resulted when there were imperfect matches to the motif showing strongest enhancer binding and gene activation. When ``optimal'' motifs were incorporated, ectopic expression ensued, with aberrant gene activation outside the nervous system. Science, this issue p. 325 Transcriptional enhancers direct precise on-off patterns of gene expression during development. To explore the basis for this precision, we conducted a high-throughput analysis of the Otx-a enhancer, which mediates expression in the neural plate of Ciona embryos in response to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and a localized GATA determinant. We provide evidence that enhancer specificity depends on submaximal recognition motifs having reduced binding affinities (``suboptimization''). Native GATA and ETS (FGF) binding sites contain imperfect matches to consensus motifs. Perfect matches mediate robust but ectopic patterns of gene expression. The native sites are not arranged at optimal intervals, and subtle changes in their spacing alter enhancer activity. Multiple tiers of enhancer suboptimization produce specific, but weak, patterns of expression, and we suggest that clusters of weak enhancers, including certain ``superenhancers,'' circumvent this trade-off in specificity and activity. Enhancer evolution is not driven by perfection but is constrained by the need for specificity. Enhancer evolution is not driven by perfection but is constrained by the need for specificity.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers are short segments of DNA that switch genes on and off in response to a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Despite the discovery of the first enhancer more than 30 y ago, the relationship between primary DNA sequence and enhancer activity remains obscure. In particular, the importance of ``syntax'' (the order, orientation, and spacing of binding sites) is unclear. A high-throughput screen identified synthetic notochord enhancers that are activated by the combination of ZicL and ETS transcription factors in Ciona embryos. Manipulation of these enhancers elucidated a ``regulatory code'' of sequence and syntax features for notochord-specific expression. This code enabled in silico discovery of bona fide notochord enhancers, including those containing low-affinity binding sites that would be excluded by standard motif identification methods. One of the newly identified enhancers maps upstream of the known enhancer that regulates Brachyury (Ci-Bra), a key determinant of notochord specification. This newly identified Ci-Bra shadow enhancer contains binding sites with very low affinity, but optimal syntax, and therefore mediates surprisingly strong expression in the notochord. Weak binding sites are compensated by optimal syntax, whereas enhancers containing high-affinity binding affinities possess suboptimal syntax. We suggest this balance has obscured the importance of regulatory syntax, as noncanonical binding motifs are typically disregarded by enhancer detection methods. As a result, enhancers with low binding affinities but optimal syntax may be a vastly underappreciated feature of the regulatory genome.},

Here we present evidence that a Ciona homolog of snail (Ci-sna) encodes a repressor of the Ci-Bra enhancer in the tail muscles. DNA-binding assays identified four Ci-Sna-binding sites in the Ci-Bra enhancer, and mutations in these sites cause otherwise normal Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes to be misexpressed in ectopic tissues, particularly the tail muscles. Selective misexpression of Ci-sna using a heterologous promoter results in the repression of Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes in the notochord. Moreover, the conversion of the Ci-Sna repressor into an activator results in the ectopic induction of Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes in the muscles, and also causes an intermixing of notochord and muscle cells during tail morphogenesis. These results suggest that Ci-Sna functions as a boundary repressor, which subdivides the mesoderm into separate notochord and tail muscle lineages.},

It has been proposed that the evolution of such cis-regulatory elements is a major source of adaptive evolution; however, the regulatory and evolutionary potential of such elements remains little understood, masked by selective constraints, drift and contingency. Here, using mutation libraries in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, we observed that most mutations in classical developmental enhancers led to changes in gene expression levels but rarely resulted in novel expression outside of the native cell- and tissue-types. In contrast, random sequences often acted as developmental enhancers, driving expression across a range of levels and cell-types, in patterns consistent with transcription factor motifs therein; random sequences including motifs for transcription factors with pioneer activity acted as enhancers even more frequently and resulting in higher levels of expression. Together, our findings suggest that the adaptive phenotypic landscapes of developmental enhancers are constrained by both enhancer architecture and chromatin accessibility. We propose that the evolution of existing enhancers is limited in its capacity to generate novel phenotypes, whereas the activity of de novo elements is a primary source of phenotypic novelty.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract = {During early zebrafish development the nodal signalling pathway patterns the embryo into three germ layers, in part by inducing the expression of no tail (ntl), which is essential for correct mesoderm formation. When nodal signalling is inhibited ntl fails to be expressed in the dorsal margin, but ventral ntl expression is unaffected. These observations indicate that ntl transcription is under both nodal-dependent and nodal-independent regulation. Consistent with these observations and with a role for ntl in mesoderm formation, some somites form within the tail region of embryos lacking nodal signalling. In an effort to understand how ntl is regulated and thus how mesoderm forms, we have mapped the elements responsible for nodal-dependent and nodal-independent expression of ntl in the margin of the embryo. Our work demonstrates that expression of ntl in the margin is the consequence of two separate enhancers, which act to mediate different mechanisms of mesoderm formation. One of these enhancers responds to nodal signalling, and the other to Wnt and BMP signalling. We demonstrate that the nodal-independent regulation of ntl is essential for tail formation. Misexpression of Wnt and BMP ligands can induce the formation of an ectopic tail, which contains somites, in embryos devoid of nodal signalling, and this tail formation is dependent on ntl function. Similarly, nodal-independent tail somite formation requires ntl. At later stages in development ntl is required for notochord formation, and our analysis has also led to the identification of the enhancer required for ntl expression in the developing notochord.},

We have defined unique molecular signatures for each of the eight cells in the posterior-most two rows of the neural plate - rows I and II. Using a combination of morpholino gene knockdown, dominant-negative forms and pharmacological inhibitors, we tested the role of three signalling pathways in defining these distinct cell identities. Nodal signalling at the 64-cell stage was found to be required to define two different neural plate domains - medial and lateral - with Nodal inducing lateral and repressing medial identities. Delta2, an early Nodal target, was found to then subdivide each of the lateral and medial domains to generate four columns. Finally, a separate signalling system along the anteroposterior axis, involving restricted ERK1/2 activation,was found to promote row I fates and repress row II fates. Our results reveal how the sequential integration of three signalling pathways - Nodal,Delta2/Notch and FGF/MEK/ERK - defines eight different sub-domains that characterise the ascidian caudal neural plate. Most remarkably, the distinct fates of the eight neural precursors are each determined by a unique combination of inputs from these three signalling pathways.},

Here, we show that, in ascidian embryos, three n{$\beta$}-catenin transcriptional targets, Foxa.a, Foxd and Fgf9/16/20, are each required for the correct initiation of both the mesoderm and endoderm gene regulatory networks. Conversely, these three factors are sufficient, in combination, to produce a mesendoderm ground state that can be further programmed into mesoderm or endoderm lineages. Importantly, we show that the combinatorial activity of these three factors is sufficient to reprogramme developing ectoderm cells to mesendoderm. We conclude that in ascidian embryos, the transient mesendoderm regulatory state is defined by co-expression of Foxa.a, Foxd and Fgf9/16/20.},

  abstract = {In embryos of an invertebrate chordate, Ciona intestinalis, two transcription factors, Foxa.a and Zic-r.b, are required for specification of the brain and the notochord, which are derived from distinct cell lineages. In the brain lineage, Foxa.a and Zic-r.b are expressed with no temporal overlap. In the notochord lineage, Foxa.a and Zic-r.b are expressed simultaneously. In the present study, we found that the temporally non-overlapping expression of Foxa.a and Zic-r.b in the brain lineage was regulated by three repressors, Prdm1-r.a (formerly called BZ1), Prdm1-r.b (BZ2) and Hes.a. In morphant embryos of these three repressor genes, Foxa.a expression was not terminated at the normal time, in addition to precocious expression of Zic-r.b. Consequently, Foxa.a and Zic-r.b were expressed simultaneously, which led to ectopic activation of Brachyury and its downstream pathways for notochord differentiation. Thus, temporal controls by transcriptional repressors are essential for specifying the two distinct fates of brain and notochord by Foxa.a and Zic-r.b. Such a mechanism might enable the repeated use of a limited repertoire of transcription factors in developmental gene regulatory networks.},

Suppression of Cs-ZicL function with specific morpholino oligonucleotide indicated that Cs-ZicL is essential for the formation of A-line notochord cells but not of B-line notochord cells, essential for the CNS formation and essential for the maintenance of muscle differentiation. The expression of Cs-ZicL in the A-line cells is downstream of {$\beta$}-catenin and a {$\beta$}-catenin-target gene, Cs-FoxD, which is expressed in the endoderm cells from the 16-cell stage and is essential for the differentiation of notochord. In spite of its pivotal role in muscle specification, the expression of Cs-ZicL in the muscle precursors is independent of Cs-macho1, which is another Zic-like gene encoding a Ciona maternal muscle determinant, suggesting another genetic cascade for muscle specification independent of Cs-macho1. Cs-ZicL may provide a future experimental system to explore how the gene expression in multiple embryonic regions is controlled and how the single gene can perform different functions in multiple types of embryonic cells.},

A cDNA for Cs-FGF4/6/9, a gene activated downstream of {$\beta$}-catenin signaling, was isolated and shown to encode an FGF protein with features of both FGF4/6 and FGF9/20. The early embryonic expression of Cs-FGF4/6/9 was transient and the transcript was seen in endodermal cells at the 16- and 32-cell stages, in notochord and muscle cells at the 64-cell stage, and in nerve cord and muscle cells at the 110-cell stage; the gene was then expressed again in cells of the nervous system after neurulation. When the gene function was suppressed with a specific antisense morpholino oligo, the differentiation of mesenchyme cells was completely blocked, and the fate of presumptive mesenchyme cells appeared to change into that of muscle cells. The inhibition of mesenchyme differentiation was abrogated by coinjection of the morpholino oligo and synthetic Cs-FGF4/6/9 mRNA. Downregulation of {$\beta$}-catenin nuclear localization resulted in the absence of mesenchyme cell differentiation due to failure of the formation of signal-producing endodermal cells. Injection of synthetic Cs-FGF4/6/9 mRNA in {$\beta$}-catenin-downregulated embryos evoked mesenchyme cell differentiation. These results strongly suggest that Cs-FGF4/6/9 produced by endodermal cells acts an inductive signal for the differentiation of mesenchyme cells. On the other hand, the role of Cs-FGF4/6/9 in the induction of notochord cells is partial; the initial process of the induction was inhibited by Cs-FGF4/6/9 morpholino oligo, but notochord-specific genes were expressed later to form a partial notochord.},

Recent decoding of genome sequences will enable us to perform such studies. An ascidian, Ciona intestinalis, one of the animals whose genome has been sequenced, is a chordate sharing a basic body plan with vertebrates, although its genome contains less paralogs than are usually seen in vertebrates. In the present study, we discuss the genomewide approach to networks of developmental genes in Ciona embryos. We focus on transcription factor genes and some major groups of signal transduction genes. These genes are comprehensively listed and examined with regard to their embryonic expression by in situ hybridization(http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/tfst.html). The results revealed that 74\% of the transcription factor genes are expressed maternally and that 56\% of the genes are zygotically expressed during embryogenesis. Of these, 34\% of the transcription factor genes are expressed both maternally and zygotically. The number of zygotically expressed transcription factor genes increases gradually during embryogenesis. As an example, and taking advantage of this comprehensive description of gene expression profiles, we identified transcription factor genes and signal transduction genes that are expressed at the early gastrula stage and that work downstream of {$\beta$}-catenin, FoxD and/or Fgf9/16/20. Because these three genes are essential for ascidian endomesoderm specification, transcription factor genes and signal transduction genes involved in each of the downstream processes can be deduced comprehensively using the present approach.},

  abstract = {A main challenge of modern biology is to understand how specific constellations of genes are activated to differentiate cells and give rise to distinct tissues. This study focuses on elucidating how gene expression is initiated in the notochord, an axial structure that provides support and patterning signals to embryos of humans and all other chordates. Although numerous notochord genes have been identified, the regulatory DNAs that orchestrate development and propel evolution of this structure by eliciting notochord gene expression remain mostly uncharted, and the information on their configuration and recurrence is still quite fragmentary. Here we used the simple chordate Ciona for a systematic analysis of notochord cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), and investigated their composition, architectural constraints, predictive ability and evolutionary conservation. We found that most Ciona notochord CRMs relied upon variable combinations of binding sites for the transcription factors Brachyury and/or Foxa2, which can act either synergistically or independently from one another. Notably, one of these CRMs contains a Brachyury binding site juxtaposed to an (AC) microsatellite, an unusual arrangement also found in Brachyury-bound regulatory regions in mouse. In contrast, different subsets of CRMs relied upon binding sites for transcription factors of widely diverse families. Surprisingly, we found that neither intra-genomic nor interspecific conservation of binding sites were reliably predictive hallmarks of notochord CRMs. We propose that rather than obeying a rigid sequence-based cis-regulatory code, most notochord CRMs are rather unique. Yet, this study uncovered essential elements recurrently used by divergent chordates as basic building blocks for notochord CRMs.},

  abstract = {In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), a core transcription factor (TF) network establishes the gene expression program necessary for pluripotency. To address how interactions between four key TFs contribute to cis-regulation in mouse ESCs, we assayed two massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) libraries composed of binding sites for SOX2, POU5F1 (OCT4), KLF4, and ESRRB. Comparisons between synthetic cis-regulatory elements and genomic sequences with comparable binding site configurations revealed some aspects of a regulatory grammar. The expression of synthetic elements is influenced by both the number and arrangement of binding sites. This grammar plays only a small role for genomic sequences, as the relative activities of genomic sequences are best explained by the predicted occupancy of binding sites, regardless of binding site identity and positioning. Our results suggest that the effects of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are influenced by the order and orientation of sites, but that in the genome the overall occupancy of TFs is the primary determinant of activity.},

With such data one might track heterogeneous cell sub-populations, and infer regulatory relationships between genes and pathways. Recently, RNA sequencing has achieved single cell resolution. What is limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual cells for quantitative in-depth sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after LIF withdrawal. The reproducibility of these high-throughput single cell data allowed us to deconstruct cell populations and infer gene expression relationships.},

Recent studies have shown that shadow enhancers are remarkably abundant and control most developmental gene expression in both invertebrates and vertebrates, including mammals. Shadow enhancers might provide an important mechanism for buffering gene expression against mutations in non-coding regulatory regions of genes implicated in human disease. Technological advances in genome editing and live imaging have shed light on how shadow enhancers establish precise gene expression patterns and confer phenotypic robustness. Shadow enhancers can interact in complex ways and may also help to drive the formation of transcriptional hubs within the nucleus. Despite their apparent redundancy, the prevalence and evolutionary conservation of shadow enhancers underscore their key role in emerging metazoan gene regulatory networks.},

Age-related changes in the intervertebral discs are thought to cause most cases of back pain. Back pain affects more than half of people over the age of 65, and the treatment of back pain costs 50\textendash 100 billion dollars per year in the USA. The normal intervertebral disc is composed of three distinct regions: a thick outer ring of fibrous cartilage called the annulus fibrosus, a gel-like material that is surrounded by the annulus fibrosus called the nucleus pulposus, and superior and inferior cartilaginous end plates. The nucleus pulposus has been shown to be critical for disc health and function. Damage to this structure often leads to disc disease. Recent reports have demonstrated that the embryonic notochord, a rod-like structure present in the midline of vertebrate embryos, gives rise to all cell types found in adult nuclei pulposi. The mechanism responsible for the transformation of the notochord into nuclei pulposi is unknown. In this review, we discuss potential molecular and physical mechanisms that may be responsible for the notochord to nuclei pulposi transition.},

Most of these regulatory DNAs are enhancers that can work over long distances--a million base pairs or more in mammals--to control gene expression. Critical enhancers are sometimes even found within the introns of neighboring genes. This review summarizes well-defined examples of enhancers controlling key processes in animal development. Potential mechanisms of transcriptional synergy are discussed with regard to enhancer structure and contemporary ChIP-sequencing assays, whereby just a small fraction of the observed binding sites represent bona fide regulatory DNAs. Finally, there is a discussion of how enhancer evolution can produce novelty in animal morphology and of the prospects for reconstructing transitions in animal evolution by introducing derived enhancers in basal ancestors.},

  abstract = {In Drosophila melanogaster, cis-regulatory modules that are activated by the Notch cell\textendash cell signaling pathway all contain two types of transcription factor binding sites: those for the pathway's transducing factor Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] and those for one or more tissue- or cell type\textendash specific factors called ``local activators.'' The use of different ``Su(H) plus local activator'' motif combinations, or codes, is critical to ensure that only the correct subset of the broadly utilized Notch pathway's target genes are activated in each developmental context. However, much less is known about the role of enhancer ``architecture''\textemdash the number, order, spacing, and orientation of its component transcription factor binding motifs\textemdash in determining the module's specificity. Here we investigate the relationship between architecture and function for two Notch-regulated enhancers with spatially distinct activities, each of which includes five high-affinity Su(H) sites. We find that the first, which is active specifically in the socket cells of external sensory organs, is largely resistant to perturbations of its architecture. By contrast, the second enhancer, active in the ``non-SOP'' cells of the proneural clusters from which neural precursors arise, is sensitive to even simple rearrangements of its transcription factor binding sites, responding with both loss of normal specificity and striking ectopic activity. Thus, diverse cryptic specificities can be inherent in an enhancer's particular combination of transcription factor binding motifs. We propose that for certain types of enhancer, architecture plays an essential role in determining specificity, not only by permitting factor\textendash factor synergies necessary to generate the desired activity, but also by preventing other activator synergies that would otherwise lead to unwanted specificities.},

To investigate how cells integrate information from extrinsic and intrinsic inputs, we examined Brachyury (Hr-Bra) promoter activity in the early embryo. Hr-Bra, which encodes a key transcription factor for notochord development, is expressed exclusively in notochord precursors in a manner dependent on the FGF-MEK-MAPK-Ets signaling pathway and on the intrinsic factors Zic and FoxA. Reporter gene expression driven by the 900-bp upstream region of the Hr-Bra promoter was detected as early as the 110-cell stage in notochord precursors by in situ hybridization with a LacZ probe. Deletion analysis combined with MEK inhibitor treatment demonstrated that the -598/-499 region carries FGF-responsiveness. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay identified three Ets-binding sites in this region that were required for promoter activity. Further deletion analysis conducted by injecting eggs with reporter constructs at higher concentration suggested that the -398/-289 region also has enhancer activity, although ectopic reporter expression was detected in nerve cord and endoderm precursors. The -398/-289 region has a Zic-binding site that was also essential for the enhancer activity. These results indicate that Ets- and Zic-binding sites are critical for the initiation of Hr-Bra expression. In conclusion, information from both extrinsic and intrinsic factors is integrated at the level of enhancer of the target gene by direct binding of the transcription factors to the enhancer region.},

  abstract = {During embryogenesis, chordates pass through a tailbud stage in which the larval tail is formed. Since acquisition of a tadpole-like tail during tailbud stage is one of the key events in the evolution of chordates, understanding the anatomy of the tailbud stage chordate embryo is of special interest. In this study, to understand comprehensively the anatomy of the tailbud embryo at single-cell-level, real microscopic image stacks of the tailbud embryo in Ciona intestinalis were reconstructed into a 3D computer model. This comprehensive 3D model of the ascidian tailbud embryo was based on real images of confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and therefore, cell shape, location and cell arrangement reflect real geometries of the tailbud embryo. We found that the tailbud embryo consists of 1579 cells, including 836 epidermal cells, 228 cells in the central nervous system, 218 mesenchymal cells, four trunk ventral cells, two B/B⁎8.11 cells, 36 muscle cells, 40 notochord cells, four primordial germ cells, and 199 endodermal cells. Moreover, we identified for the first time two populations of previously undefined cells (a total of 12 cells) in Ciona: one located in the lateral trunk and the other located under the tail dorsal epidermis. This information provides a first step for understanding how the body plan of the chordate tailbud embryo formed and evolved.},

  abstract = {Divergent morphology of species has largely been ascribed to genetic differences in the tissue-specific expression of proteins, which could be achieved by divergence in cis-regulatory elements or by altering the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs). The relative importance of the latter has been difficult to assess, as previous systematic analyses of TF binding specificity have been performed using different methods in different species. To address this, we determined the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs, and compared them to human and mouse data. This analysis revealed that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, and that for orthologous TFs, the similarity extends even to the level of very subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.           ,              Flies look very different from humans, but both are descended from a common ancestor that existed over 600 million years ago. Some differences between animal species are due to them having different genes: stretches of DNA that contain the instructions to make proteins and other molecules. However, often differences are caused by the same or similar genes being switched on and off at different times and in different tissues in each species.             The instructions that control when and where a gene is expressed are written in the sequence of DNA bases located in the regulatory region of the gene. These instructions are written in a language that is often called the `gene regulatory code'. This code is read and interpreted by proteins called transcription factors that bind to specific sequences of DNA (or `DNA words') and increase or decrease gene expression. Changes in gene expression between species could therefore be due to changes in the transcription factors and/or changes in the instructions within the regulatory regions of specific genes.             Gene regulatory regions are not well conserved between species. However, it is unclear if the instructions in these regions are written using the same gene regulatory code, and whether transcription factors found in different species recognize different DNA words.             Nitta et al. have now used high-throughput methods to identify the DNA words recognized by 242 transcription factors from a fruit fly called Drosophila melanogaster. Nitta et al. then used new computational tools to find motifs, or collections of DNA words, that are recognized by each of the transcription factors. By comparing the motifs, they observed that, in spite of more than 600 million years of evolution, almost all known motifs found in humans and mice were recognized by fruit fly transcription factors.             Nitta et al. noted that both fruit flies and humans have transcription factors that recognize a few unique motifs, and confer properties that are specific to each species. For example, some of the transcription factors that control the development of the fruit fly wing are not present in humans. Moreover, fruit flies lack both mucus-producing goblet cells and the ability to recognize a motif read by the transcription factor that controls the development of these cells in humans.             The findings of Nitta et al. also indicate that transcription factors do not evolve to recognize subtly different DNA motifs, but instead appear constrained to recognize the same motifs. Thus, much like the genetic code that instructs how to build proteins, the gene regulatory code that determines how DNA sequences direct gene expression is also highly conserved in animals. The language used to guide the development of animals has, as such, remained very similar for millions of years. What makes animals different is differences in the content and length of the instructions that are written using this language into the regulatory regions of their genes.},

The opportunity to study entire transcriptomes in great detail using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has fueled many important discoveries and is now a routine method in biomedical research. However, RNA-seq is typically performed in ``bulk,'' and the data represent an average of gene expression patterns across thousands to millions of cells; this might obscure biologically relevant differences between cells. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) represents an approach to overcome this problem. By isolating single cells, capturing their transcripts, and generating sequencing libraries in which the transcripts are mapped to individual cells, scRNA-seq allows assessment of fundamental biological properties of cell populations and biological systems at unprecedented resolution. Here, we present the most common scRNA-seq protocols in use today and the basics of data analysis and discuss factors that are important to consider before planning and designing an scRNA-seq project. \textcopyright{} 2018 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Muscular dystrophy is frequently caused by disruption of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), which links muscle cells to the extracellular matrix. Dystroglycan, a central component of the DGC, serves as a laminin receptor via its extracellular {$\alpha$} subunit, and interacts with dystrophin (and thus the actin cytoskeleton) through its integral membrane {$\beta$} subunit. We have removed the function of dystroglycan in zebrafish embryos. In contrast to mouse, where dystroglycan mutations lead to peri-implantation lethality, dystroglycan is dispensable for basement membrane formation during early zebrafish development. At later stages, however, loss of dystroglycan leads to a disruption of the DGC, concurrent with loss of muscle integrity and necrosis. In addition, we find that loss of the DGC leads to loss of sarcomere and sarcoplasmic reticulum organisation. The DGC is required for long-term survival of muscle cells in zebrafish, but is dispensable for muscle formation. Dystroglycan or the DGC is also required for normal sarcomere and sarcoplasmic reticulum organisation. Because zebrafish embryos lacking dystroglycan share several characteristics with human muscular dystrophy, they should serve as a useful model for the disease. In addition, knowing the dystroglycan null phenotype in zebrafish will facilitate the isolation of other molecules involved in muscular dystrophy pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {The notochord is a defining feature of the chordate body plan. Experiments in ascidian, frog and mouse embryos have shown that co-expression of Brachyury and FoxA class transcription factors is required for notochord development. However, studies on the cis-regulatory sequences mediating the synergistic effects of these transcription factors are complicated by the limited knowledge of notochord genes and cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that are directly targeted by both. We have identified an easily testable model for such investigations in a 155-bp notochord-specific CRM from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. This CRM contains functional binding sites for both Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) and FoxA (Ci-FoxA-a). By combining point mutation analysis and misexpression experiments, we demonstrate that binding of both transcription factors to this CRM is necessary and sufficient to activate transcription. To gain insights into the cis-regulatory criteria controlling its activity, we investigated the organization of the transcription factor binding sites within the 155-bp CRM. The 155-bp sequence contains two Ci-Bra binding sites with identical core sequences but opposite orientations, only one of which is required for enhancer activity. Changes in both orientation and spacing of these sites substantially affect the activity of the CRM, as clusters of identical sites found in the Ciona genome with different arrangements are unable to activate transcription in notochord cells. This work presents the first evidence of a synergistic interaction between Brachyury and FoxA in the activation of an individual notochord CRM,and highlights the importance of transcription factor binding site arrangement for its function.},

Many examples of such cell divisions have been described, but so far only a limited number of the underlying mechanisms have been elucidated. Here,we have uncovered a novel mechanism controlling an asymmetric cell division in the ascidian embryo. This division produces one notochord and one neural precursor. Differential activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase(ERK) between the sibling cells determines their distinct fates, with ERK activation promoting notochord fate. We first demonstrate that the segregation of notochord and neural fates is an autonomous property of the mother cell and that the mother cell acquires this functional polarity via interactions with neighbouring ectoderm precursors. We show that these cellular interactions are mediated by the ephrin-Eph signalling system, previously implicated in controlling cell movement and adhesion. Disruption of contacts with the signalling cells or inhibition of the ephrin-Eph signal results in the symmetric division of the mother cell, generating two notochord precursors. Finally, we demonstrate that the ephrin-Eph signal acts via attenuation of ERK activation in the neural-fated daughter cell. We propose a model whereby directional ephrin-Eph signals functionally polarise the notochord/neural mother cell, leading to asymmetric modulation of the FGF-Ras-ERK pathway between the daughter cells and, thus, to their differential fate specification.},

Here, we perform RNAseq on flow-sorted notochord cells from multiple stages to define a comprehensive Ciona notochord transcriptome. We identify 1364 genes with enriched expression and extensively validate the results by in situ hybridization. These genes are highly enriched for Gene Ontology terms related to the extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton. Orthologs of 112 of the Ciona notochord genes have known notochord expression in vertebrates, more than twice as many as predicted by chance alone. This set of putative effector genes with notochord expression conserved from tunicates to vertebrates will be invaluable for testing hypotheses about notochord evolution. The full set of Ciona notochord genes provides a foundation for systems-level studies of notochord gene regulation and morphogenesis. We find only modest overlap between this set of notochord-enriched transcripts and the genes upregulated by ectopic expression of the key notochord transcription factor Brachyury, indicating that Brachyury is not a notochord master regulator gene as strictly defined.},

The transcription factor Brachyury (Bra) is a key regulator of notochord fate but here we show that it is not a unitary master regulator in the model chordate Ciona. Ectopic Bra expression only partially reprograms other cell types to a notochord-like transcriptional profile and a subset of notochord-enriched genes is unaffected by CRISPR Bra disruption. We identify Foxa.a and Mnx as potential co-regulators, and find that combinatorial cocktails are more effective at reprogramming other cell types than Bra alone. We reassess the network relationships between Bra, Foxa.a and other components of the notochord gene regulatory network, and find that Foxa.a expression in the notochord is regulated by vegetal FGF signaling. It is a direct activator of Bra expression and has a binding motif that is significantly enriched in the regulatory regions of notochord-enriched genes. These and other results indicate that Bra and Foxa.a act together in a regulatory network dominated by positive feed-forward interactions, with neither being a classically defined master regulator.},

These multidimensional data allowed us to establish a reference system of metrics to quantify key developmental events including blastopore closure and muscle extension. The approach we describe can be used to document morphogenetic cell and tissue rearrangements in living embryos and paves the way for a live digitized anatomical atlas of Ciona. genesis 43:136\textendash 147, 2005.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the maternal factors that initiate early chordate development, and of their direct zygotic targets, is still fragmentary. A molecular cascade is emerging for the mesendoderm, but less is known about the ectoderm, giving rise to epidermis and nervous tissue. Our cis-regulatory analysis surprisingly places the maternal transcription factor Ci-GATAa(GATA4/5/6) at the top of the ectodermal regulatory network in ascidians. Initially distributed throughout the embryo, Ci-GATAa activity is progressively repressed in vegetal territories by accumulating maternal{$\beta$}-catenin. Once restricted to the animal hemisphere, Ci-GATAa directly activates two types of zygotic ectodermal genes. First, Ci-fog is activated from the 8-cell stage throughout the ectoderm, then Ci-otxis turned on from the 32-cell stage in neural precursors only. Whereas the enhancers of both genes contain critical and interchangeable GATA sites, their distinct patterns of activation stem from the additional presence of two Ets sites in the Ci-otx enhancer. Initially characterized as activating elements in the neural lineages, these Ets sites additionally act as repressors in non-neural lineages, and restrict GATA-mediated activation of Ci-otx. We thus identify a precise combinatorial code of maternal factors responsible for zygotic onset of a chordate ectodermal genetic program.},

We describe a new course, focusing on enriching the curriculum of life science students with abstract, algorithmic, and logical thinking, and exposing them to the computational ``culture.'' The design, structure, and content of our course are influenced by recent efforts in this area, collaborations with life scientists, and our own instructional experience. Specifically, we suggest that an effective course of this nature should: (1) devote time to explicitly reflect upon computational thinking processes, resisting the temptation to drift to purely practical instruction, (2) focus on discrete notions, rather than on continuous ones, and (3) have basic programming as a prerequisite, so students need not be preoccupied with elementary programming issues. We strongly recommend that the mere use of existing bioinformatics tools and packages should not replace hands-on programming. Yet, we suggest that programming will mostly serve as a means to practice computational thinking processes. This paper deals with the challenges and considerations of such computational education for life science students. It also describes a concrete implementation of the course and encourages its use by others.},

The T-box transcription factor brachyury (T) is essential for both formation of the notochord and maintenance of NMPs, and thus is a key regulator of trunk and tail development. The T promoter controlling T expression in NMPs and nascent mesoderm has been characterized in detail; however, control elements for T expression in the notochord have not been identified yet. We have generated a series of deletion alleles by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in mESCs, and analyzed their effects in mutant mouse embryos. We identified a 37\hspace{0.25em}kb region upstream of T that is essential for notochord function and tailbud outgrowth. Within that region, we discovered a T-binding enhancer required for notochord cell specification and differentiation. Our data reveal a complex regulatory landscape controlling cell type-specific expression and function of T in NMP/nascent mesoderm and node/notochord, allowing proper trunk and tail development.},

The study uses a quantitative image-based reporter assay that incorporates a dual-reporter strategy to control for variable electroporation efficiency. We identified and mutated multiple predicted transcription factor binding sites of interest based on statistical matches to the JASPAR binding motif database. Most sites (Zic, Ets, FoxA, RBPJ) were selected based on prior knowledge of cell fate specification in both the primary and secondary notochord. We also mutated predicted Brachyury sites to investigate potential autoregulation as well as Fos/Jun (AP1) sites that had very strong matches to JASPAR. Our goal was to quantitatively define the relative importance of these different sites, to explore the importance of predicted high-affinity versus low-affinity motifs, and to attempt to design mutant enhancers that were specifically expressed in only the primary or secondary notochord lineages. We found that the mutation of all predicted high-affinity sites for Zic, FoxA or Ets led to quantifiably distinct effects. The FoxA construct caused a severe loss of reporter expression whereas the Ets construct had little effect. A strong Ets phenotype was only seen when much lower-scoring binding sites were also mutated. This supports the enhancer suboptimization hypothesis proposed by Farley and Levine but suggests that it may only apply to some but not all transcription factor families. We quantified reporter expression separately in the two notochord lineages with the expectation that Ets mutations and RBPJ mutations would have distinct effects given that primary notochord is induced by Ets-mediated FGF signaling whereas secondary notochord is induced by RBPJ/Su(H)-mediated Notch/Delta signaling. We found, however, that ETS mutations affected primary and secondary notochord expression relatively equally and that RBPJ mutations were only moderately more severe in their effect on secondary versus primary notochord. Our results point to the promise of quantitative reporter assays for understanding cis-regulatory logic but also highlight the challenge of arbitrary statistical thresholds for predicting potentially important sites.},

  abstract = {The notochord is a key structure during chordate development. We have previously identified several enhancers regulated by Zic and ETS that encode notochord activity within the marine chordate Ciona robusta (Ciona). To better understand the role of Zic and ETS within notochord enhancers, we tested 90 genomic elements containing Zic and ETS sites for expression in developing Ciona embryos using a whole-embryo, massively parallel reporter assay. We discovered that 39/90 of the elements were active in developing embryos; however only 10\% were active within the notochord, indicating that more than just Zic and ETS sites are required for notochord expression. Further analysis revealed notochord enhancers were regulated by three groups of factors: (1) Zic and ETS, (2) Zic, ETS and Brachyury (Bra), and (3) Zic, ETS, Bra and FoxA. One of these notochord enhancers, regulated by Zic and ETS, is located upstream of laminin alpha, a gene critical for notochord development in both Ciona and vertebrates. Reversing the ETS sites in this enhancer greatly diminish expression, indicating that enhancer grammar is critical for enhancer activity. Strikingly, we find clusters of Zic and ETS binding sites within the introns of mouse and human laminin alpha 1 with conserved enhancer grammar. Our analysis also identified two notochord enhancers regulated by Zic, ETS, FoxA and Bra binding sites: the Bra Shadow (BraS) enhancer located in close proximity to Bra, and an enhancer located near the gene Lrig. Randomizing the BraS enhancer demonstrates that although the Zic and ETS sites are necessary for enhancer activity, they are not sufficient. We find that FoxA and Bra sites contribute to BraS enhancer activity. Zic, ETS, FoxA and Bra binding sites occur within the Ciona Bra434 enhancer and vertebrate notochord Brachyury enhancers, suggesting a conserved regulatory logic. Collectively, this study deepens our understanding of how enhancers encode notochord expression, illustrates the importance of enhancer grammar, and hints at the conservation of enhancer logic and grammar across chordates.},

In addition to its 12 previously identified protein-binding sites, sparkling is densely populated with previously unmapped regulatory sequences, which interact in complex ways to control gene expression. One segment is essential for activation at a distance, yet dispensable for other activation functions and for cell type patterning. Unexpectedly, rearranging sparkling's regulatory sites converts it into a robust photoreceptor-specific enhancer. Our results show that a single combination of regulatory inputs can encode multiple outputs, and suggest that the enhancer's organization determines the correct expression pattern by facilitating certain short-range regulatory interactions at the expense of others.},

  abstract = {Considerable progress towards an understanding of complex diseases has been made in recent years due to the development of high-throughput genotyping technologies. Using microarrays that contain millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Genome Wide Association Studies (GWASs) have identified SNPs that are associated with many complex diseases or traits. For example, as of February 2015, 2111 association studies have identified 15,396 SNPs for various diseases and traits, with the number of identified SNP-disease/trait associations increasing rapidly in recent years. However, it has been difficult for researchers to understand disease risk from GWAS results. This is because most GWAS-identified SNPs are located in non-coding regions of the genome. It is important to consider that the GWAS-identified SNPs serve only as representatives for all SNPs in the same haplotype block, and it is equally likely that other SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the array-identified SNPs are causal for the disease. Because it was hoped that disease-associated coding variants would be identified if the true casual SNPs were known, investigators have expanded their analyses using LD calculation and fine-mapping. However, such analyses also identified risk-associated SNPs located in non-coding regions. Thus, the GWAS field has been left with the conundrum as to how a single-nucleotide change in a non-coding region could confer increased risk for a specific disease. One possible answer to this puzzle is that the variant SNPs cause changes in gene expression levels rather than causing changes in protein function. This review provides a description of (1) advances in genomic and epigenomic approaches that incorporate functional annotation of regulatory elements to prioritize the disease risk-associated SNPs that are located in non-coding regions of the genome for follow-up studies, (2) various computational tools that aid in identifying gene expression changes caused by the non-coding disease-associated SNPs, and (3) experimental approaches to identify target genes of, and study the biological phenotypes conferred by, non-coding disease-associated SNPs.},

  abstract = {The Brachyury genes of two divergent ascidians, As-T of Halocynthia roretzi and Ci-Bra of Ciona intestinalis, are expressed exclusively in notochord precursor cells. A previous study showed that the notochord-specific expression of Ci-Bra is controlled by a minimal promoter that is composed of three distinct regions: a region responsible for repression of expression in non-notochord mesoderm cells, a region for activation of expression in notochord cells, and a region for activation of expression in non-notochord mesoderm cells, distal to proximal to the transcription initiation site, respectively. We examined various deletion constructs of the As-T/lacZ fusion gene and demonstrate that a module between -289 and -250 bp of the 5{${'}$}-flanking region is responsible for notochord-specific expression of the reporter gene. Gel-shift assays suggested the binding of nuclear protein(s) to this module. The 5{${'}$}-flanking region of As-T contains a potential T-binding motif (-ACCTAGGT-) around -160 bp. Deletion of this motif from the p(-289)As-T/lacZ diminished the reporter gene expression. In addition, coinjection of p(-289)As-T/lacZ and synthetic As-T mRNA resulted in ectopic expression of lacZ in non-notochord cells, suggesting that the T-binding motif is responsible for autoactivation of the gene. These findings revealed striking differences between the minimal promoters of As-T and Ci-Bra so far revealed, with respect to their notochord-specific expression. Furthermore, reciprocal injections of reporter gene constructs, namely As-T/lacZ into Ciona eggs and Ci-Bra/lacZ into Halocynthia eggs, suggest alterations in the cis-regulatory elements and trans-activation factors that have occurred during evolution of the two ascidian species.},

Here we show that the recessive short-tailed Ciona savignyi mutation chongmague(chm) has a novel defect in the formation of a morphological boundary around the developing notochord. chm notochord cells initiate intercalation normally, but then fail to maintain their polarized cell morphology and migrate inappropriately to become dispersed in the larval tail. This is unlike aimless (aim), a mutation in the PCP pathway component Prickle, which has a severe defect in early mediolateral intercalation but forms a robust notochord boundary. Positional cloning identifies chm as a mutation in the C. savignyi ortholog of the vertebrate alpha 3/4/5 family of laminins. Cs-lam{$\alpha$}3/4/5 is highly expressed in the developing notochord, and Cs-lam{$\alpha$}3/4/5 protein is specifically localized to the outer border of the notochord. Notochord convergence and extension, reduced but not absent in both chm and aim, are essentially abolished in the aim/aim; chm/chm double mutant, indicating that laminin-mediated boundary formation and PCP-dependent mediolateral intercalation are each able to drive a remarkable degree of tail morphogenesis in the absence of the other. These mechanisms therefore initially act in parallel, but we also find that PCP signaling has an important later role in maintaining the perinotochordal/intranotochordal polarity of Cs-lam{$\alpha$}3/4/5 localization.},

To address this question, we integrate human variation information from the 1000 Genomes Project and activity data from the ENCODE Project. A broad range of transcribed and regulatory nonconserved elements show decreased human diversity, suggesting lineage-specific purifying selection. Conversely, conserved elements lacking activity show increased human diversity, suggesting that some recently became nonfunctional. Regulatory elements under human constraint in nonconserved regions were found near color vision and nerve-growth genes, consistent with purifying selection for recently evolved functions. Our results suggest continued turnover in regulatory regions, with at least an additional 4\% of the human genome subject to lineage-specific constraint.},

Descriptive studies in a broad range of tunicates have revealed several important unifying traits that make them unique among the chordates, including invariant cell lineages through gastrula stages and an overall morphological simplicity. Gastrulation has only been studied in detail in ascidians such as Ciona and Phallusia, where it involves a simple cup-shaped gastrula driven primarily by endoderm invagination. This appears to differ significantly from vertebrate models, such as Xenopus, in which mesoderm convergent extension and epidermal epiboly are major contributors to involution.

Most blastomeres in the model chordate                 Ciona robusta                 become restricted to a single predominant fate between the 64-cell and mid-gastrula stages.

This is the first ascidian study to use droplet scRNAseq with large numbers of analyzed cells as early as the 64-cell stage when major lineages such as primary notochord first become fate restricted.                                                        Results and conclusions                                We identify 59 distinct cell states, including new subregions of the b-line neural lineage and the early induction of the tail tip epidermis. We find that 34 of these cell states are directly or indirectly dependent on MAPK-mediated signaling critical to early                 Ciona                 patterning. Most of the MAPK-dependent bifurcations are canalized with the signal-induced cell fate lost upon MAPK inhibition, but the posterior endoderm is unique in being transformed into a novel state expressing some but not all markers of both endoderm and muscle. Divergent gene expression between newly bifurcated sibling cell types is dominated by upregulation in the induced cell type. The Ets family transcription factor Elk1/3/4 is uniquely upregulated in nearly all the putatively direct inductions. Elk1/3/4 upregulation together with Ets transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis enables inferences about which bifurcations are directly versus indirectly controlled by MAPK signaling. We examine notochord induction in detail and find that the transition between a Zic/Ets-mediated regulatory state and a Brachyury/FoxA-mediated regulatory state is unexpectedly late. This supports a ``broad-hourglass'' model of cell fate specification in which many early tissue-specific genes are induced in parallel to key tissue-specific transcriptional regulators via the same set of transcriptional inputs.},

  abstract = {Enhancer function, from sponges to humans Identifying the function of enhancers, DNA regions that help to regulate gene expression and evolve rapidly, has been difficult. This area of research has been hampered by the difficultly in identifying functional conservation. Wong et al. now show that despite low sequence conservation, enhancer function is strongly conserved through the animal kingdom (see the Perspective by Harmston). Transgenic expression of sponge enhancers in zebrafish and mice demonstrates that these sequences can drive cell type\textendash specific gene expression across species. These results suggest an unexpectedly deep level of conservation of gene regulation across the animal kingdom maintained over the course of metazoan evolution. Science, this issue p. eaax8137; see also p. 657 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONIn animals, gene regulatory networks specify cell identity in space and time. Transcription of genes in these networks is modulated by a class of cis-regulatory elements called enhancers that contain short (\textasciitilde 10 base pairs) DNA sequence motifs recognized by transcription factors (TFs). In contrast to TFs, whose histories have been largely traced to the origin of the animal kingdom or earlier, the origin and evolution of enhancers have been relatively difficult to discern.Although not a single enhancer has been shown to be conserved across the animal kingdom, enhancers may be as ancient and conserved as the TFs with which they interact. This inability to identify conserved enhancers is apparently because they evolve faster than both the TFs they interact with and the genes they regulate. RATIONALEPutative enhancers in the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica had previously been identified on the basis of combinatorial patterns of histone modifications. Here, we sought to determine whether sponges share functionally conserved enhancers with bilaterians.We primarily focused on deeply conserved metazoan microsyntenic gene pairs. These pairs are thought to be conserved because the cis-regulatory elements that regulate the developmental expression of one gene (the target gene) are located in the other gene (the bystander gene). This proposed regulatory linkage may underlie the maintenance of these microsyntenic gene pairs across 700 million years of independent evolution. RESULTSWe found that enhancers present in Amphimedon microsyntenic regions drive consistent patterns of cell type\textendash specific gene expression in zebrafish and mouse embryos. Although these sponge enhancers do not share significant sequence identity with vertebrates, they are in microsyntenic regions that are orthologous with microsyntenic regions in other metazoans and have strong histone H3 Lys4 methylation (H3K4me1) enhancer signals.Focusing on an Islet enhancer in the Islet-Scaper microsyntenic region, we found that the sponge 709\textendash base pair enhancer, independent of its orientation, drives green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in zebrafish cells in the hindbrain neuroepithelial region, the roof plate around the midline, the pectoral fin, and the otic vesicle; the activity overlaps with endogenous Isl2a expression. Systematic removal of sequences from the Amphimedon Islet enhancer revealed that both the 5{${'}$} and 3{${'}$} regions of this enhancer are required for consistent cell type\textendash specific activity in zebrafish.We then used the number and frequency of TF binding motifs in the Amphimedon Islet enhancer to identify putative enhancers in human, mouse, and fly Islet-Scaper regions. The candidate orthologous enhancers from humans and mice drove gene expression patterns similar to those in sponges and endogenous Islet enhancers in zebrafish.We also demonstrated that a number of putative Amphimedon enhancers, which are outside conserved microsyntenic regions, can also drive unique expression patterns: Enhancers of sponge housekeeping genes drive broader expression patterns in zebrafish. CONCLUSIONThese results suggest the existence of an ancient and conserved, yet flexible, genomic regulatory syntax that (i) can be interpreted by the available TFs present in cells constituting disparate developmental systems and cell types, and (ii) has been repeatedly co-opted into cell type\textendash specific networks across the animal kingdom.This common regulatory code maintains a repertoire of conserved TF binding motifs that stabilize and preserve enhancer functionality over evolution. Once established, these enhancers may be maintained as part of conserved gene regulatory network modules over evolution. Although robust, these enhancers can evolve through the expansion and integration of new TF binding motifs and the loss of others. We posit that the expansion of TFs and enhancers may underlie the evolution of complex body plans. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/370/6517/eaax8137/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Islet enhancer activity is conserved across animal evolution.Enhancers located within conserved microsyntenic units in the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica are tested in a zebrafish transgenic reporter system. In zebrafish, the sponge Islet enhancer drives a GFP reporter expression pattern similar to that of human, mouse, and zebrafish enhancers identified within the Islet-Scaper microsyntenic region. This suggests the conservation of regulatory syntax specified by flexible organizations of motifs. Interactions of transcription factors (TFs) with DNA regulatory sequences, known as enhancers, specify cell identity during animal development. Unlike TFs, the origin and evolution of enhancers has been difficult to trace. We drove zebrafish and mouse developmental transcription using enhancers from an evolutionarily distant marine sponge. Some of these sponge enhancers are located in highly conserved microsyntenic regions, including an Islet enhancer in the Islet-Scaper region. We found that Islet enhancers in humans and mice share a suite of TF binding motifs with sponges, and that they drive gene expression patterns similar to those of sponge and endogenous Islet enhancers in zebrafish. Our results suggest the existence of an ancient and conserved, yet flexible, genomic regulatory syntax that has been repeatedly co-opted into cell type\textendash specific gene regulatory networks across the animal kingdom. Across the animal kingdom, enhancer function is conserved throughout 700 million years of evolution.

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section In ascidian embryos, Brachyury is expressed exclusively in blastomeres of the notochord lineage and play an essential role in the notochord cell differentiation. The genetic cascade leading to the transcriptional activation of Brachyury in A-line notochord cells of Ciona embryos begins with maternally provided {$\beta$}-catenin, which is essential for endodermal cell specification. {$\beta$}-catenin directly activates zygotic expression of a forkhead transcription factor gene, FoxD, at the 16-cell stage, which in turn somehow activates a zinc finger transcription factor gene, ZicL, at the 32-cell stage, and then Brachyury at the 64-cell stage. One of the key questions to be answered is whether ZicL functions as a direct activator of Brachyury transcription, and this was addressed in the present study. A fusion protein was constructed in which a zinc finger domain of Ciona ZicL was connected to the C-terminus of GST. Extensive series of PCR-assisted binding site selection assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the most plausible recognition sequence of Ciona ZicL was CCCGCTGTG. We found the elements CACAGCTGG (complementary sequence: CCAGCTGTG) at -123 and CCAGCTGTG at -168 bp upstream of the putative transcription start site of Ci-Bra in a previously identified basal enhancer of this gene. In vitro binding assays indicated that the ZicL fusion protein binds to these elements efficiently. A fusion gene construct in which lacZ was fused with the upstream sequence of Ci-Bra showed the reporter gene expression exclusively in notochord cells when the construct was introduced into fertilized eggs. In contrast, fusion constructs with mutated ZicL-binding-elements failed to show the reporter expression. In addition, suppression of Ci-ZicL abolished the reporter gene expression, while ectopic and/or overexpression of Ci-ZicL resulted in ectopic reporter expression in non-notochord cells. These results provide evidence that ZicL directly activates Brachyury, leading to specification and subsequent differentiation of notochord cells.},
