  abstract = {Teaching students with very diverse backgrounds can be extremely challenging. This article uses the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology MSc in Amsterdam as a case study to describe how the knowledge gap for students with heterogeneous backgrounds can be bridged. We show that a mix in backgrounds can be turned into an advantage by creating a stimulating learning environment for the students. In the MSc Programme, conversion classes help to bridge differences between students, by mending initial knowledge and skill gaps. Mixing students from different backgrounds in a group to solve a complex task creates an opportunity for the students to reflect on their own abilities. We explain how a truly interdisciplinary approach to teaching helps students of all backgrounds to achieve the MSc end terms. Moreover, transferable skills obtained by the students in such a mixed study environment are invaluable for their later careers.},

This literature review focuses on the concept of OER, its essential definitions, its potential benefits, its open nature, and various aspects of adoption. The research findings indicate that the OER movement has not expanded fully into educational sectors, and the level of faculty and student awareness is quite low. The research also reveals that the current status of OER adoption in educational sectors is minimal. Additionally, OER adoption has encountered several obstacles; potential users have difficulty finding the proper OER materials, and there are quality control issues with resources. However, students saved a significant amount of money when OER replaced traditional textbooks. Many critical issues related to OER adoption must be resolved, and others may arise as more faculty and students begin to use these resources.},

We also provide insights and practical ideas on how curriculum change can be brought about, including advice for faculty members who are motivated to become agents of change. Change almost always elicits opposing and supporting forces, examples of which are given. We discuss examples of strategies to deal with these forces and highlight various factors that need to be considered when implementing such strategies, including the concepts of a zone of feasible innovation, the zone of tolerance, and the development of faculty learning communities. Finally, we summarize recommendations for educators and future education research directions such as the need to study barriers and incentives for incorporating authentic biology research into the undergraduate curriculum and to characterize effective strategies for institutional change.},

Genes are regulated by interactions with multiple transcription factors and the target sites for the transcription factors required for the control of each gene constitute its cis-regulatory system. These systems are remarkably complex. Their hardwired internal organization enables them to behave as genomic information processing systems. Developmental gene regulatory networks consist of the cis-regulatory systems of all the relevant genes and the regulatory linkages amongst them. Though there is yet little explicit information, some general properties of genomic regulatory networks have become apparent. The key to understanding how genomic regulatory networks are organized, and how they work, lies in experimental analysis of cis-regulatory systems at all levels of the regulatory network.},

  abstract = {The intervertebral disc (IVD) comprises a gelatinous inner core (nucleus pulposus; NP) and concentric rings (annulus fibrosus; AF). The NP, an important structure for shock absorption in the vertebrate spinal motion segment, can be traced back to the notochord in ontogenetic lineage. In vertebrates, the notochord undergoes mucinoid changes, and had been considered vestigial until recently. However, observed correlations between IVD degeneration and back pain in humans have renewed interest in the IVD in biomedical fields. Beyond its mechanical contribution to development, the notochord is also an essential signaling center, which coordinates formation of the neural tube and somites. The pertinent signaling molecules, particularly TGF-{$\beta$} and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), continue to play roles in the adult tissues and have been utilized for tissue regeneration. Genetic factors are major determinants of who will develop IVD degeneration and related back pain, and seem to correlate better with disc degeneration and back pain than do external forces on the spine. In summary, the spinal column is a landmark development in evolution. Genes directing the development of the IVD may also contribute to its maintenance, degeneration, and regeneration. Likewise, structural genes as well as genes responsible for maintenance of the structure are related to IVD degeneration. Finally, genes responsible for inflammation may play a dual role in exacerbating degeneration or facilitating repair responses depending on the context.},

Basic data stewardship is still taught relatively rarely in life science education programmes, creating a chasm between theory and practice, and fuelling demand for bioinformatics training across all educational levels and career roles. Concerned by this, surveys have been conducted in recent years to monitor bioinformatics and computational training needs worldwide. This article briefly reviews the principal findings of a number of these studies. We see that there is still a strong appetite for short courses to improve expertise and confidence in data analysis and interpretation; strikingly, however, the most urgent appeal is for bioinformatics to be woven into the fabric of life science degree programmes. Satisfying the relentless training needs of current and future generations of life scientists will require a concerted response from stakeholders across the globe, who need to deliver sustainable solutions capable of both transforming education curricula and cultivating a new cadre of trainer scientists.},

  abstract = {Chronic low back pain is the number one cause of years lived with disability. In about 40\% of patients, chronic lower back pain is related to intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The standard-of-care focuses on symptomatic relief, while surgery is the last resort. Emerging therapeutic strategies target the underlying cause of IVD degeneration and increasingly focus on the relatively overlooked notochordal cells (NCs). NCs are derived from the notochord and once the notochord regresses they remain in the core of the developing IVD, the nucleus pulposus. The large vacuolated NCs rapidly decline after birth and are replaced by the smaller nucleus pulposus cells with maturation, ageing, and degeneration. Here, we provide an update on the journey of NCs and discuss the cell markers and tools that can be used to study their fate and regenerative capacity. We review the therapeutic potential of NCs for the treatment of IVD-related lower back pain and outline important future directions in this area. Promising studies indicate that NCs and their secretome exerts regenerative effects, via increased proliferation, extracellular matrix production, and anti-inflammatory effects. Reports on NC-like cells derived from embryonic- or induced pluripotent-stem cells claim to have successfully generated NC-like cells but did not compare them with native NCs for phenotypic markers or in terms of their regenerative capacity. Altogether, this is an emerging and active field of research with exciting possibilities. NC-based studies demonstrate that cues from developmental biology can pave the path for future clinical therapies focused on regenerating the diseased IVD.},

It is a rod-like mesodermal structure that runs the anterior\textendash posterior length of the embryo, adjacent to the ventral neural tube. The notochord plays a critical role in embryonic tissue patterning, for example the dorsal\textendash ventral patterning of the neural tube. The cells that will come to form the notochord are specified at gastrulation. Axial mesodermal cells arising at the anterior primitive streak migrate anteriorly as the precursors of the notochord and populate the notochordal plate. Yet, even though a lot of interest has centered on investigating the functional and structural roles of the notochord, we still have a very rudimentary understanding of notochord morphogenesis. The events driving the formation of the notochord are rapid, taking place over the period of approximately a day in mice. In this commentary, we provide an overview of our current understanding of mouse notochord morphogenesis, from the initial specification of axial mesendodermal cells at the primitive streak, the emergence of these cells at the midline on the surface of the embryo, to their submergence and organization of the stereotypically positioned notochord.

The best understood type of DNA sequence, which was also the first to be discovered, is that which encodes RNA and protein products via the near-universal ``genetic code'' (1). A more mysterious but equally important class of functional DNA is cis- regulatory sequence, which does not have a physical product but, instead, encodes the conditions under which a particular RNA will be produced. Cis -regulatory DNA sequences are the primary (although not the only) determinant of gene expression: Not only the rate of RNA production but also the timing, spatial patterning, and environmental control of every gene's activity are largely controlled by these DNA sequences, which are usually in the general vicinity of the gene they regulate. These DNA segments (often called enhancers) have no enzymatic activity on their own, but act as scaffolds for large complexes of proteins and RNAs that directly control the activity of a gene's promoter, sometimes over distances of 1 million base pairs or more (2). Transcription factors (TFs), key protein regulators of gene expression, bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner, which means that the nature of the complex assembled at a given enhancer at a given time depends on its DNA sequence ( cis information), in conjunction with the set of TFs present and active in the cell \ldots{}  [{$\carriagereturn$}][1]1Email: sbarolo\{at\}umich.edu.

In ascidian embryos, FGF/MAPK-mediated activation of the transcription factor Ets1/2 is required for heart tissue specification and cell migration. We found that FoxF is one of the first genes to be activated in heart precursors in response to FGF signaling. We identified the FoxF minimal heart enhancer and used a cis-trans complementation test to show that Ets1/2 can interact with the FoxF enhancer in vivo. Next, we found that FoxF function is required downstream and in parallel to the FGF/MAPK/Ets cascade for cell migration. In addition, we demonstrated that targeted expression of a dominant-negative form of FoxF inhibits cell migration but not heart differentiation, resulting in a striking phenotype: a beating heart at an ectopic location within the body cavity of juveniles. Taken together, our results indicate that FoxF is a direct target of FGF signaling and is predominantly involved in the regulation of heart cell migration.},

The purpose of this article is to explore the benefits of using emerging technology tools such as wikis, blogs, and podcasts to foster student interaction in online learning. It also reviews social software applications such as Writeboard\texttrademark, InstaColl\texttrademark, and Imeem\texttrademark. Although emerging technologies offer a vast range of opportunities for promoting collaboration in both synchronous and asynchronous learning environments, distance education programs around the globe face challenges that may limit or deter implementation of these technologies. This article probes the influence of technology on theory and the possible implications this influence affords.},

In these schools, replete with metal detectors, armed guards and police, digital fingerprinting, video security systems, X-ray machines, texting-tip incentives, and bodily searches, poor youth, especially African American and Latino, are subjected to increasing levels of physical and psychological surveillance, confinement, and regimentation. Complementarily, stringent discipline policies, rising school expulsions, and narcotizing test-driven curricula, are inducing enraged hopelessness and forcing these youth out of schools at alarming rates. The physical restrictions, panoptic monitoring, and repressive measures imposed within the school walls are complemented by federal policies and nation-wide educational practices, such as school uniforms, zero tolerance policies, rote education, punitive sanctions and schools closing for low achievement on standardized tests, biometrics in schools, and proliferate JROTC programs, which signify the need for discipline, obedience, and conformity. This growing culture of militarism has been created within grossly underfunded, tax-based schools and in rapidly increasing numbers of corporate-and Pentagon-sponsored military academies for middle and high school youth in poor communities of color. Since youth identities in these communities are discursively constructed as under-achieving, behavior-problematic, violence-prone, unmotivated, education-aversive youth (i.e., the dregs of society, in need of regulatory control and restraint), who were born to aggress and fail, the imposition and presence of enforcement policies to ``civilize their untamed spirits'' seems merited and quite natural.},

This paper synthesizes existing literature on CUREs and assessment practices to propose a framework for how researchers and practitioners may better align the goals and evaluation practices of CUREs in order to provide a more consistent view of these reformed laboratory courses for the field.},

One teacher and the 21 students in her intact United States history class participated in the study. The central unit problem required students to determine the strategies that should be pursued in 1968 to continue the struggle for a more just, equal United States society. Students worked in teams to gather data from an electronic database of primary- and secondary-source materials, and use the data to develop solutions to the unit problem. Results of this study suggest that a variety of factors impact the success or failure of student-centered activities, including student orientation to the unit problem, student collaboration, teacher management strategies, and student accountability mechanisms. These results also provide insight into how the design of these types of activities can be improved. Perhaps the most important considerations that need additional attention are the additional aids required by teachers as they struggle to implement these types of activities in their classrooms.},

Additionally, rare isolated embryonic notochord cells remained in the vertebral column and resembled ``notochordal remnants,'' which in humans have been proposed to give rise to a rare type of late-onset cancer called chordoma. Previously, this cell type had not been identified in the mouse model system. The development and characterization of a mouse model that can be used to fate map nucleus pulposus precursor cells in any mutant background will be useful for uncovering the cellular and molecular mechanisms of disk degeneration.

Analysis of established type 2 diabetes risk loci revealed a striking clustering of distinct homeo-box TFBS. We identified the PRRX1 homeobox factor as a repressor of PPARG2 expression in adipose cells and demonstrate its adverse effect on lipid metabolism and systemic insulin sensitivity, dependent on the rs4684847 risk allele that triggers PRRX1 binding. Thus, cross-species conservation analysis at the level of co-occurring TFBS provides a valuable contribution to the translation of genetic association signals to disease-related molecular mechanisms.},

Results indicate that OER adoption does much more than simply save students money and address student debt concerns. OER improve end-of-course grades and decrease DFW (D, F, and Withdrawal letter grades) rates for all students. They also improve course grades at greater rates and decrease DFW rates at greater rates for Pell recipient students, part-time students, and populations historically underserved by higher education. OER address affordability, completion, attainment gap concerns, and learning. These findings contribute to a broadening perception of the value of OERs and their relevance to the great challenges facing higher education today.},

Different members of the family exert different effects and here we show that much of the specificity of the Xenopus T box proteins Xbra, VegT and Eomesodermin resides in the DNA-binding domain, or T box. Binding site selection experiments show that the three proteins bind the same core sequence, but they select paired sites that differ in their orientation and spacing. Lysine 149 of Xbra is conserved in all Brachyury homologues, while the corresponding amino acid in VegT and Eomesodermin is asparagine. Mutation of this amino acid to lysine changes the inductive abilities of VegT and Eomesodermin to resemble that of Xbra.},

  abstract = {The notochord is an embryonic midline structure common to all members of the phylum Chordata, providing both mechanical and signaling cues to the developing embryo. In vertebrates, the notochord arises from the dorsal organizer and it is critical for proper vertebrate development. This evolutionary conserved structure located at the developing midline defines the primitive axis of embryos and represents the structural element essential for locomotion. Besides its primary structural function, the notochord is also a source of developmental signals that patterns surrounding tissues. Among the signals secreted by the notochord, Hedgehog proteins play key roles during embryogenesis. The Hedgehog signaling pathway is a central regulator of embryonic development, controlling the patterning and proliferation of a wide variety of organs. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on notochord structure and functions, with a particular emphasis on the key developmental events that take place in vertebrates. Moreover, we discuss some genetic studies highlighting the phenotypic consequences of impaired notochord development, which enabled to understand the molecular basis of different human congenital defects and diseases.},

Ciona has a small genome, and simple, well-defined embyronic lineages. Here, we examine the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differentiation of the notochord. Particular efforts center on the regulation of a notochord-specific Ciona Brachyury gene (Ci-Bra). An electroporation method was devised for the efficient incorporation of transgenic DNA into Ciona embryos. This method permitted the identification of a minimal, 434 bp enhancer from the Ci-Bra promoter region that mediates the notochord-restricted expression of both GFP and lacZ reporter genes. This enhancer contains a negative control region that excludes Ci-Bra expression from inappropriate embryonic lineages, including the trunk mesenchyme and tail muscles. Evidence is presented that the enhancer is activated by a regulatory element which is closely related to the recognition sequence of the Suppressor of Hairless transcription factor, thereby raising the possibility that the Notch signaling pathway plays a role in notochord differentiation. We discuss the implications of this analysis with regard to the evolutionary conservation of integrative enhancers, and the subdivision of the axial and paraxial mesoderm in vertebrates.},

These data can be explored through three complementary types of browsers, each offering a different view-point. A developmental browser summarizes the information in a gene- or territory-centric manner. Advanced genomic browsers integrate the genetic features surrounding genes or gene sets within a species. A Genomicus synteny browser explores the conservation of local gene order across deuterostome. This new release covers an extended taxonomic range of 14 species, including for the first time a non-ascidian species, the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica. Functional annotations, provided for each species, were enhanced through a combination of manual curation of gene models and the development of an improved orthology detection pipeline. Finally, gene expression profiles and anatomical territories can be explored in 4D online through the newly developed Morphonet morphogenetic browser.},

Here, we measure the expression output of {$>$}100 million synthetic yeast promoter sequences that are fully random. These sequences yield diverse, reproducible expression levels that can be explained by their chance inclusion of functional TF binding sites. We use machine learning to build interpretable models of transcriptional regulation that predict \textasciitilde 94\% of the expression driven from independent test promoters and \textasciitilde 89\% of the expression driven from native yeast promoter fragments. These models allow us to characterize each TF's specificity, activity and interactions with chromatin. TF activity depends on binding-site strand, position, DNA helical face and chromatin context. Notably, expression level is influenced by weak regulatory interactions, which confound designed-sequence studies. Our analyses show that massive-throughput assays of fully random DNA can provide the big data necessary to develop complex, predictive models of gene regulation.},

Proper knowledge of the development of the human notochord, therefore, is important to understand the pathogenesis of these birth defects. Textbook descriptions vary significantly and seem to be derived from both human and animal data whereas the lack of references hampers verification of the presented data. Therefore, a verifiable and comprehensive description of the development of the human notochord is needed. Our analysis and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of 27 sectioned human embryos ranging from Carnegie Stage 8 to 15 (17\textendash 41 days of development), resulted in a comprehensive and verifiable new model of notochordal development. Subsequent to gastrulation, a transient group of cells briefly persists as the notochordal process which is incorporated into the endodermal roof of the gut while its dorsal side attaches to the developing neural tube. Then, the notochordal process embeds entirely into the endoderm, forming the epithelial notochordal plate, which remains intimately associated with the neural tube. Subsequently, the notochordal cells detach from the endoderm to form the definitive notochord, allowing the paired dorsal aortae to fuse between the notochord and the gut. We show that the formation of the notochordal process and plate proceeds in cranio-caudal direction. Moreover, in contrast to descriptions in the modern textbooks, we report that the formation of the definitive notochord in humans starts in the middle of the embryo, and proceeds in both cranial and caudal directions.},

The Ciona genome contains approximately 16,000 protein-coding genes, similar to the number in other invertebrates, but only half that found in vertebrates. Vertebrate gene families are typically found in simplified form in Ciona, suggesting that ascidians contain the basic ancestral complement of genes involved in cell signaling and development.

  abstract = {Brachyury is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator that is essential for notochord differentiation in a variety of chordates. In vertebrates, Brachyury is expressed throughout the presumptive mesoderm, but becomes restricted to the notochord at later stages of development. In ascidians, such as Ciona intestinalis, Brachyury is expressed exclusively in the notochord and does not exhibit an early pan-mesodermal pattern. Subtractive hybridization screens were recently used to identify potential Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) target genes (Takahashi, H., Hotta, K., Erives, A., Di Gregorio, A., Zeller, R. W., Levine, M. and Satoh, N. (1999). Genes Dev. 13, 1519\textendash 1523). Of the genes that were identified in this screen, one corresponds to a new member of the tropomyosin superfamily, Ciona tropomyosin (Ci-trop). Here we show that Ci-trop is specifically expressed in the developing notochord beginning at gastrulation, and expression persists in the notochord during tailbud and tadpole stages. A 3 kb region of the Ci-trop 5{${'}$}-flanking sequence was characterized via electroporation of lacZ fusion genes into fertilized Ciona eggs. A minimal, 114 bp enhancer was identified that is sufficient to direct the expression of a heterologous promoter in the notochord. DNA binding assays indicate that this enhancer contains two sets of low-affinity Brachyury half-sites, which are bound in vitro by a GST/Ci-Bra fusion protein. Deletion of the distal sites inactivates the notochord-specific staining pattern mediated by an otherwise normal Ci-trop/lacZ transgene. These results suggest that Ci-trop is a direct target gene of Ci-Bra and that Brachyury plays an immediate role in the cellular morphogenesis of the notochord.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large ({$>$}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {$>$}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 \texttimes{} 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

This anxiety impairs performance and reduces motivation by introducing a self-evaluative threat. More than 300 studies have verified that people underperform when put in situations that cause stereotype threat. Documented consequences of stereotype threat include decreased performance; blaming failure on internal, rather than external, causes; and distancing oneself from a setting that generates stereotype threat (e.g. changing one's major from engineering or computer science). Given the plethora of research available on practices that increase or reduce stereotype threat, a set of recommended practices can now be used in engineering education to reduce stereotype threat and thereby increase the performance of potentially threatened groups. In this paper, we provide an easy to use and research supported list of best practices to reduce stereotype threat in engineering education.},

The literature review includes related philosophical topics, a summary of what other professionals in the field have written about student-centered facilitation, and an overview of eight generations of facilitation. The author argues that teacher-centered facilitation is problematic in experiential education and justifies increasing the use of student-centered facilitation practices. Suggestions are provided for: (a) establishing forums for dialog about student-centered facilitation, (b) incorporating more student-centered facilitation practices, and (c) considering student-centered learning during program development and facilitator training. The author concludes that the profession's very commitment to integrity necessitates that we, as experiential educators, take action in order to ensure that our programs become more student-centered.},

However, few analyses look at the perceptions of the females that have stayed in the field. In this paper, we explore the viewpoints of female academics and postgraduate students in Computer Science with various undergraduate backgrounds and pathways into academia. Our analysis of their interviews shows the influence of family, exposure, culture, sexism and gendered thought on their perceptions of the field, and of themselves and their peers.

Farley et al. systematically examined millions of synthetic variants of the Otx enhancer, a motif needed for gene expression in the nervous system of the sea squirt Ciona. Proper gene activity resulted when there were imperfect matches to the motif showing strongest enhancer binding and gene activation. When ``optimal'' motifs were incorporated, ectopic expression ensued, with aberrant gene activation outside the nervous system. Science, this issue p. 325 Transcriptional enhancers direct precise on-off patterns of gene expression during development. To explore the basis for this precision, we conducted a high-throughput analysis of the Otx-a enhancer, which mediates expression in the neural plate of Ciona embryos in response to fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling and a localized GATA determinant. We provide evidence that enhancer specificity depends on submaximal recognition motifs having reduced binding affinities (``suboptimization''). Native GATA and ETS (FGF) binding sites contain imperfect matches to consensus motifs. Perfect matches mediate robust but ectopic patterns of gene expression. The native sites are not arranged at optimal intervals, and subtle changes in their spacing alter enhancer activity. Multiple tiers of enhancer suboptimization produce specific, but weak, patterns of expression, and we suggest that clusters of weak enhancers, including certain ``superenhancers,'' circumvent this trade-off in specificity and activity. Enhancer evolution is not driven by perfection but is constrained by the need for specificity. Enhancer evolution is not driven by perfection but is constrained by the need for specificity.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers are short segments of DNA that switch genes on and off in response to a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Despite the discovery of the first enhancer more than 30 y ago, the relationship between primary DNA sequence and enhancer activity remains obscure. In particular, the importance of ``syntax'' (the order, orientation, and spacing of binding sites) is unclear. A high-throughput screen identified synthetic notochord enhancers that are activated by the combination of ZicL and ETS transcription factors in Ciona embryos. Manipulation of these enhancers elucidated a ``regulatory code'' of sequence and syntax features for notochord-specific expression. This code enabled in silico discovery of bona fide notochord enhancers, including those containing low-affinity binding sites that would be excluded by standard motif identification methods. One of the newly identified enhancers maps upstream of the known enhancer that regulates Brachyury (Ci-Bra), a key determinant of notochord specification. This newly identified Ci-Bra shadow enhancer contains binding sites with very low affinity, but optimal syntax, and therefore mediates surprisingly strong expression in the notochord. Weak binding sites are compensated by optimal syntax, whereas enhancers containing high-affinity binding affinities possess suboptimal syntax. We suggest this balance has obscured the importance of regulatory syntax, as noncanonical binding motifs are typically disregarded by enhancer detection methods. As a result, enhancers with low binding affinities but optimal syntax may be a vastly underappreciated feature of the regulatory genome.},

When required resources exceed available resources?that is, when a state of cognitive overload is reached?both memory sensitivity and criterion bias drop dramatically while STRTs get faster. The results provide support for the contention that secondary task reaction times are often very fast during highly complex messages because the system is overloaded and therefore resources are shifted from the primary task to the secondary task. Also of interest, the liberal shift in criterion bias starts before overload has occurred, suggesting that criterion bias may be tracking available resources.},

  abstract = {Intervertebral disc degeneration proceeds with age and is one of the major causes of lumbar pain and degenerative lumbar spine diseases. However, studies in the field of intervertebral disc biology have been hampered by the lack of reliable cell lines that can be used for in vitro assays. In this study, we show that a chordoma-derived cell line U-CH1-N cells highly express the nucleus pulposus (NP) marker genes, including T (encodes T brachyury transcription factor), KRT19, and CD24. These observations were further confirmed by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. Reporter analyses showed that transcriptional activity of T was enhanced in U-CH1-N cells. Chondrogenic capacity of U-CH1-N cells was verified by evaluating the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and Alcian blue staining. Of note, we found that proliferation and synthesis of chondrogenic ECM proteins were largely dependent on T in U-CH1-N cells. In accordance, knockdown of the T transcripts suppressed the expression of PCNA, a gene essential for DNA replication, and SOX5 and SOX6, the master regulators of chondrogenesis. On the other hand, the CD24-silenced cells showed no reduction in the mRNA expression level of the chondrogenic ECM genes. These results suggest that U-CH1-N shares important biological properties with notochordal NP cells and that T plays crucial roles in maintaining the notochordal NP cell-like phenotype in this cell line. Taken together, our data indicate that U-CH1-N may serve as a useful tool in studying the biology of intervertebral disc. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors.

Here we present evidence that a Ciona homolog of snail (Ci-sna) encodes a repressor of the Ci-Bra enhancer in the tail muscles. DNA-binding assays identified four Ci-Sna-binding sites in the Ci-Bra enhancer, and mutations in these sites cause otherwise normal Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes to be misexpressed in ectopic tissues, particularly the tail muscles. Selective misexpression of Ci-sna using a heterologous promoter results in the repression of Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes in the notochord. Moreover, the conversion of the Ci-Sna repressor into an activator results in the ectopic induction of Ci-Bra/lacZ transgenes in the muscles, and also causes an intermixing of notochord and muscle cells during tail morphogenesis. These results suggest that Ci-Sna functions as a boundary repressor, which subdivides the mesoderm into separate notochord and tail muscle lineages.},

To gain insight into the biological functions of Arx, we performed a genome-wide expression screen to identify transcriptional changes within the subpallium in the absence of Arx. We have identified 84 genes whose expression was dysregulated in the absence of Arx. This population was enriched in genes involved in cell migration, axonal guidance, neurogenesis, and regulation of transcription and includes genes implicated in autism, epilepsy, and mental retardation; all features recognized in patients with ARX mutations. Additionally, we found Arx directly repressed three of the identified transcription factors: Lmo1, Ebf3 and Shox2. To further understand how the identified genes are involved in neural development, we used gene set enrichment algorithms to compare the Arx gene regulatory network (GRN) to the Dlx1/2 GRN and interneuron transcriptome. These analyses identified a subset of genes in the Arx GRN that are shared with that of the Dlx1/2 GRN and that are enriched in the interneuron transcriptome. These data indicate Arx plays multiple roles in forebrain development, both dependent and independent of Dlx1/2, and thus provides further insights into the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathology of mental retardation and epilepsy phenotypes resulting from ARX mutations.},

It has been proposed that the evolution of such cis-regulatory elements is a major source of adaptive evolution; however, the regulatory and evolutionary potential of such elements remains little understood, masked by selective constraints, drift and contingency. Here, using mutation libraries in Drosophila melanogaster embryos, we observed that most mutations in classical developmental enhancers led to changes in gene expression levels but rarely resulted in novel expression outside of the native cell- and tissue-types. In contrast, random sequences often acted as developmental enhancers, driving expression across a range of levels and cell-types, in patterns consistent with transcription factor motifs therein; random sequences including motifs for transcription factors with pioneer activity acted as enhancers even more frequently and resulting in higher levels of expression. Together, our findings suggest that the adaptive phenotypic landscapes of developmental enhancers are constrained by both enhancer architecture and chromatin accessibility. We propose that the evolution of existing enhancers is limited in its capacity to generate novel phenotypes, whereas the activity of de novo elements is a primary source of phenotypic novelty.},

As a consequence, our current understanding of human development is mostly based on the anatomical and histological studies on Carnegie Collection of human embryos, which were carried out more than half a century ago. Due to the 14-day rule on human embryo research, there have been no experimental studies beyond the fourteenth day of human development. Mutagenesis studies on animal models, mostly in mouse, are often extrapolated to human embryos to understand the transcriptional regulation of human development. However, due to the existence of significant differences in their morphological and molecular features as well as the time scale of their development, it is obvious that complete knowledge of human development can be achieved only by studying the human embryo. These studies require a cellular framework. Here we summarize the cellular, molecular, and temporal aspects associated with human gastrulation and discuss how they relate to existing human PSCs based models of early development.},

Various features influence TF binding and enhancer function\textemdash including the chromatin state of the genomic locus, the affinities of the binding site, the activity of the bound TFs, and interactions among TFs. However, the precise nature and relative contributions of these features remain unclear. Here, we used massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) involving 32,115 natural and synthetic enhancers, together with high-throughput in vivo binding assays, to systematically dissect the contribution of each of these features to the binding and activity of genomic regulatory elements that contain motifs for PPAR{$\gamma$}, a TF that serves as a key regulator of adipogenesis. We show that distinct sets of features govern PPAR{$\gamma$} binding vs. enhancer activity. PPAR{$\gamma$} binding is largely governed by the affinity of the specific motif site and higher-order features of the larger genomic locus, such as chromatin accessibility. In contrast, the enhancer activity of PPAR{$\gamma$} binding sites depends on varying contributions from dozens of TFs in the immediate vicinity, including interactions between combinations of these TFs. Different pairs of motifs follow different interaction rules, including subadditive, additive, and superadditive interactions among specific classes of TFs, with both spatially constrained and flexible grammars. Our results provide a paradigm for the systematic characterization of the genomic features underlying regulatory elements, applicable to the design of synthetic regulatory elements or the interpretation of human genetic variation.},

Multimodal analysis substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract = {During early zebrafish development the nodal signalling pathway patterns the embryo into three germ layers, in part by inducing the expression of no tail (ntl), which is essential for correct mesoderm formation. When nodal signalling is inhibited ntl fails to be expressed in the dorsal margin, but ventral ntl expression is unaffected. These observations indicate that ntl transcription is under both nodal-dependent and nodal-independent regulation. Consistent with these observations and with a role for ntl in mesoderm formation, some somites form within the tail region of embryos lacking nodal signalling. In an effort to understand how ntl is regulated and thus how mesoderm forms, we have mapped the elements responsible for nodal-dependent and nodal-independent expression of ntl in the margin of the embryo. Our work demonstrates that expression of ntl in the margin is the consequence of two separate enhancers, which act to mediate different mechanisms of mesoderm formation. One of these enhancers responds to nodal signalling, and the other to Wnt and BMP signalling. We demonstrate that the nodal-independent regulation of ntl is essential for tail formation. Misexpression of Wnt and BMP ligands can induce the formation of an ectopic tail, which contains somites, in embryos devoid of nodal signalling, and this tail formation is dependent on ntl function. Similarly, nodal-independent tail somite formation requires ntl. At later stages in development ntl is required for notochord formation, and our analysis has also led to the identification of the enhancer required for ntl expression in the developing notochord.},

While several studies have explored undergraduate perceptions of CUREs, no previous study has qualitatively described GTAs' perceptions about teaching CUREs, despite the essential instructional role GTAs play. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to describe and ascribe meaning to the perceptions that GTAs have regarding benefits and challenges with instructional experiences in introductory biology CUREs. We conducted semistructured interviews with 11 GTAs instructing an introductory biology CURE at a 4-year public university. We found that, while GTAs perceived professional benefits such as experience in research mentoring and postsecondary teaching, they also described challenges, including the time required to instruct a CURE, motivating students to take ownership, and a lack of expertise in mentoring undergraduates about a copepod-based CURE. Feelings of inadequacy in serving as a research mentor and high levels of critical thinking were also cited as perceived issues. We recommend that the greater responsibility and increased time commitment perceived by GTAs in the current study warrants reconsideration by lab coordinators and administrators as to what content and practices should be included in pedagogical training specifically designed for CURE GTAs and how departmental and institutional policies may need to be adapted to better implement CUREs.},

The extreme level of polymorphism in its population has inspired novel approaches in genome assembly, which we here continue to develop. Specifically, we present the reconstruction of all of               C. savignyi               's chromosomes via the development of a comprehensive genetic map, without a physical map intermediate. The resulting genetic map is complete, having one linkage group for each one of the 14 chromosomes. Eighty-three percent of the reference genome sequence is covered. The chromosomal reconstruction allowed us to investigate the evolution of genome structure in highly polymorphic species, by comparing the genome of               C. savignyi               to its divergent sister species,               Ciona intestinalis               . Both genomes have been extensively reshaped by intrachromosomal rearrangements. Interchromosomal changes have been extremely rare. This is in striking contrast to what has been observed in vertebrates, where interchromosomal events are commonplace.

Those who believe intelligence is fixed and cannot be changed exert less effort to succeed. Students who persevere when faced with challenges and adversity seem to have what Angela Duckworth calls, grit. This is the idea behind a growth mindset in learning according to Dweck (1999, 2007, 2010) and Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, and Kelly (2007). Grit can be defined as ``\ldots passion and perseverance for long-term goals\ldots '' (Frontiers In Psychology, 2014).~ One grit effect study was conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Army and the University of Pennsylvania to create predictors of retention. The purpose of this present work is to explore researched competencies related to persistence in reaching academic goals, review literature in grit and growth mindset related to learning and persistence, and examine what educators can do to foster grit and a growth mindset.~ Recommendations for increasing persistence and grit in college students will be provided.},

The main exposure was survey completion date (March 10\textendash 16, 2020). The outcome was mental distress measured via the 4-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire. Results. Among states with 50 or more COVID-19 cases as of March 10, each additional day was significantly associated with an 11\% increase in the odds of moving up a category of distress (odds ratio\,=\,1.11; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.01, 1.21; P\,=\,.02). Perceptions about the likelihood of getting infected, death from the virus, and steps taken to avoid infecting others were associated with increased mental distress in the model that included all states. Individuals with higher consumption of alcohol or cannabis or with history of depressive symptoms were at significantly higher risk for mental distress. Conclusions. These data suggest that as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, mental distress may continue to increase and should be regularly monitored. Specific populations are at high risk for mental distress, particularly those with preexisting depressive symptoms.},

Knockdown of Ptf1a activity results in their loss, while misexpression results in the appearance of supernumerary DA/coronet cells. Photoreceptor cells and ependymal cells are the most susceptible to transformation, and both cell types express high levels of Meis. Coexpression of both Ptf1a and Meis caused the wholesale transformation of the entire CNS into DA/coronet cells. We therefore suggest that the reiterative use of functional manipulations and single-cell RNA-seq assays is an effective means for the identification of regulatory cocktails underlying the specification of specific cell identities.},

  abstract = {How might we better address the pervasive inequities in CS education? While empirical efforts have advanced pedagogy, created innovative learning tools, and deepened our understanding of learner cognition, we are still failing many students. Disparities in who can access and who succeeds in CS persist. In this position paper I argue that we need to reconsider how we approach CS education research (CSER). Prior research discussions have focused on methodologies, but research designs are influenced by more than strategies and methods of data collection. They are also guided by philosophies of how the world works. Philosophical views dominant in CSER have served us well in answering questions such as which instructional approaches lead to greater achievement or how do alternative programming conceptions develop. However, confronting systemic problems that prevent some learners from being at the table might require a transformative research lens. I introduce critical theory as a means to put inequities and the voices of the marginalized at the fore of our research. This is demonstrated through the analysis of three examples: a narrative ethnographic analysis of the power differences in a researcher practitioner partnership serving Latinx youth; an autoethnography of a Black scholar's journey into an IT career; and a survey study examining the relationship between interest, stereotypes and CS career intentions in students from minoritized groups. Lastly, I offer a call to action for increasing the use and acceptance of critical theory in our dissemination venues and professional development opportunities.},

We have defined unique molecular signatures for each of the eight cells in the posterior-most two rows of the neural plate - rows I and II. Using a combination of morpholino gene knockdown, dominant-negative forms and pharmacological inhibitors, we tested the role of three signalling pathways in defining these distinct cell identities. Nodal signalling at the 64-cell stage was found to be required to define two different neural plate domains - medial and lateral - with Nodal inducing lateral and repressing medial identities. Delta2, an early Nodal target, was found to then subdivide each of the lateral and medial domains to generate four columns. Finally, a separate signalling system along the anteroposterior axis, involving restricted ERK1/2 activation,was found to promote row I fates and repress row II fates. Our results reveal how the sequential integration of three signalling pathways - Nodal,Delta2/Notch and FGF/MEK/ERK - defines eight different sub-domains that characterise the ascidian caudal neural plate. Most remarkably, the distinct fates of the eight neural precursors are each determined by a unique combination of inputs from these three signalling pathways.},

Although this is likely to represent an evolutionary ancient developmental process, the regulatory architecture of n{$\beta$}-catenin-induced mesendoderm remains elusive in the majority of animals. Here, we show that, in ascidian embryos, three n{$\beta$}-catenin transcriptional targets, Foxa.a, Foxd and Fgf9/16/20, are each required for the correct initiation of both the mesoderm and endoderm gene regulatory networks. Conversely, these three factors are sufficient, in combination, to produce a mesendoderm ground state that can be further programmed into mesoderm or endoderm lineages. Importantly, we show that the combinatorial activity of these three factors is sufficient to reprogramme developing ectoderm cells to mesendoderm. We conclude that in ascidian embryos, the transient mesendoderm regulatory state is defined by co-expression of Foxa.a, Foxd and Fgf9/16/20.},

In the brain lineage, Foxa.a and Zic-r.b are expressed with no temporal overlap. In the notochord lineage, Foxa.a and Zic-r.b are expressed simultaneously. In the present study, we found that the temporally non-overlapping expression of Foxa.a and Zic-r.b in the brain lineage was regulated by three repressors, Prdm1-r.a (formerly called BZ1), Prdm1-r.b (BZ2) and Hes.a. In morphant embryos of these three repressor genes, Foxa.a expression was not terminated at the normal time, in addition to precocious expression of Zic-r.b. Consequently, Foxa.a and Zic-r.b were expressed simultaneously, which led to ectopic activation of Brachyury and its downstream pathways for notochord differentiation. Thus, temporal controls by transcriptional repressors are essential for specifying the two distinct fates of brain and notochord by Foxa.a and Zic-r.b. Such a mechanism might enable the repeated use of a limited repertoire of transcription factors in developmental gene regulatory networks.},

In ascidians, however, descriptions and interpretations about expression of the developmental genes regarded as region specific have become not necessarily consistent. To address this issue, we examined detailed expression of key developmental genes for the ascidian CNS, including Otx, Pax2/5/8a, En, Fgf8/17/18, Dmbx, Lhx3 and Hox genes, in the CNS around the junction of the trunk and tail of three different tailbud-stage embryos of Ciona intestinalis, employing double-fluorescence in situ hybridization, followed by staining with DAPI to precisely locate expressing cells for each gene. Based on these observations, we have constructed detailed gene expression maps of the region at the tailbud stages. Our analysis shows that expression of several genes regarded as markers for specific domains in the ascidian CNS changes dynamically within a relatively short period. This motivates us to revisit to the tripartite ground plan and the origin of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) region.},

Suppression of Cs-ZicL function with specific morpholino oligonucleotide indicated that Cs-ZicL is essential for the formation of A-line notochord cells but not of B-line notochord cells, essential for the CNS formation and essential for the maintenance of muscle differentiation. The expression of Cs-ZicL in the A-line cells is downstream of {$\beta$}-catenin and a {$\beta$}-catenin-target gene, Cs-FoxD, which is expressed in the endoderm cells from the 16-cell stage and is essential for the differentiation of notochord. In spite of its pivotal role in muscle specification, the expression of Cs-ZicL in the muscle precursors is independent of Cs-macho1, which is another Zic-like gene encoding a Ciona maternal muscle determinant, suggesting another genetic cascade for muscle specification independent of Cs-macho1. Cs-ZicL may provide a future experimental system to explore how the gene expression in multiple embryonic regions is controlled and how the single gene can perform different functions in multiple types of embryonic cells.},

A cDNA for Cs-FGF4/6/9, a gene activated downstream of {$\beta$}-catenin signaling, was isolated and shown to encode an FGF protein with features of both FGF4/6 and FGF9/20. The early embryonic expression of Cs-FGF4/6/9 was transient and the transcript was seen in endodermal cells at the 16- and 32-cell stages, in notochord and muscle cells at the 64-cell stage, and in nerve cord and muscle cells at the 110-cell stage; the gene was then expressed again in cells of the nervous system after neurulation. When the gene function was suppressed with a specific antisense morpholino oligo, the differentiation of mesenchyme cells was completely blocked, and the fate of presumptive mesenchyme cells appeared to change into that of muscle cells. The inhibition of mesenchyme differentiation was abrogated by coinjection of the morpholino oligo and synthetic Cs-FGF4/6/9 mRNA. Downregulation of {$\beta$}-catenin nuclear localization resulted in the absence of mesenchyme cell differentiation due to failure of the formation of signal-producing endodermal cells. Injection of synthetic Cs-FGF4/6/9 mRNA in {$\beta$}-catenin-downregulated embryos evoked mesenchyme cell differentiation. These results strongly suggest that Cs-FGF4/6/9 produced by endodermal cells acts an inductive signal for the differentiation of mesenchyme cells. On the other hand, the role of Cs-FGF4/6/9 in the induction of notochord cells is partial; the initial process of the induction was inhibited by Cs-FGF4/6/9 morpholino oligo, but notochord-specific genes were expressed later to form a partial notochord.},

  abstract = {Achieving a real understanding of animal development obviously requires a comprehensive rather than partial identification of the genes working in each developmental process. Recent decoding of genome sequences will enable us to perform such studies. An ascidian, Ciona intestinalis, one of the animals whose genome has been sequenced, is a chordate sharing a basic body plan with vertebrates, although its genome contains less paralogs than are usually seen in vertebrates. In the present study, we discuss the genomewide approach to networks of developmental genes in Ciona embryos. We focus on transcription factor genes and some major groups of signal transduction genes. These genes are comprehensively listed and examined with regard to their embryonic expression by in situ hybridization(http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/tfst.html). The results revealed that 74\% of the transcription factor genes are expressed maternally and that 56\% of the genes are zygotically expressed during embryogenesis. Of these, 34\% of the transcription factor genes are expressed both maternally and zygotically. The number of zygotically expressed transcription factor genes increases gradually during embryogenesis. As an example, and taking advantage of this comprehensive description of gene expression profiles, we identified transcription factor genes and signal transduction genes that are expressed at the early gastrula stage and that work downstream of {$\beta$}-catenin, FoxD and/or Fgf9/16/20. Because these three genes are essential for ascidian endomesoderm specification, transcription factor genes and signal transduction genes involved in each of the downstream processes can be deduced comprehensively using the present approach.},

While the companion report, Student Perspectives of Community College Pathways to Computer Science Bachelor's Degrees (Lyon \& Denner, 2016), takes a qualitative approach to understanding the challenges facing underrepresented community college students in California who hope to transfer and complete a bachelor's degree in CS, this report investigates the national landscape of CS students at community colleges in order to better understand student behaviors and institutional characteristics that support or hinder community college students' efforts to attain a CS bachelor's degree. Key findings and recommendations: In general, the data suggest that navigating the community college pathway to a CS bachelor's degree is complex and challenging, such that only students who are focused and fortunate are able to navigate the pathway successfully. To create more structured and supported pathways that will help a larger number of underrepresented community college students to attain a CS bachelor's degree, two- and four-year colleges \textemdash{} particularly those in major technology hubs \textemdash{} need to partner more closely together. In particular:  \guillemotright{} Nearby community colleges and four-year colleges should work together to create CS-specific program maps that guarantee acceptance to the destination college's CS-related majors if students complete specific courses with a specific grade point average.  \guillemotright{} Program maps should include options for different levels of math and science preparation based on the specific requirements of certain CS subfields, and should perhaps include a CS-specific prebaccalaureate award as a formal stepping-stone to transfer, in order to entice more CS associate degree earners to transfer into CS programs at four-year colleges.  \guillemotright{} Community colleges should proactively recruit underrepresented students into CS majors, emphasizing the wide array of creative, prosocial, and well-paid careers available to those with CS expertise.  \guillemotright{} Four-year colleges should encourage transfer students to select a major prior to transfer, and for those who choose a CS major, provide tailored support services, proactively track progress, and intervene when students appear to be veering ``off track.''  \guillemotright{} CS departments should emphasize the career rewards that come with completing a higher degree, ensure that students encounter interesting and meaningful programming assignments, and encourage students to work collaboratively on assignments.},

  abstract = {A main challenge of modern biology is to understand how specific constellations of genes are activated to differentiate cells and give rise to distinct tissues. This study focuses on elucidating how gene expression is initiated in the notochord, an axial structure that provides support and patterning signals to embryos of humans and all other chordates. Although numerous notochord genes have been identified, the regulatory DNAs that orchestrate development and propel evolution of this structure by eliciting notochord gene expression remain mostly uncharted, and the information on their configuration and recurrence is still quite fragmentary. Here we used the simple chordate Ciona for a systematic analysis of notochord cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), and investigated their composition, architectural constraints, predictive ability and evolutionary conservation. We found that most Ciona notochord CRMs relied upon variable combinations of binding sites for the transcription factors Brachyury and/or Foxa2, which can act either synergistically or independently from one another. Notably, one of these CRMs contains a Brachyury binding site juxtaposed to an (AC) microsatellite, an unusual arrangement also found in Brachyury-bound regulatory regions in mouse. In contrast, different subsets of CRMs relied upon binding sites for transcription factors of widely diverse families. Surprisingly, we found that neither intra-genomic nor interspecific conservation of binding sites were reliably predictive hallmarks of notochord CRMs. We propose that rather than obeying a rigid sequence-based cis-regulatory code, most notochord CRMs are rather unique. Yet, this study uncovered essential elements recurrently used by divergent chordates as basic building blocks for notochord CRMs.},

In this review, we provide a concise overview about the scRNA-seq technology, experimental and computational procedures for transforming the biological and molecular processes into computational and statistical data. We also provide an explanation of the key technological steps in implementing the technology. We highlight a few examples on how scRNA-seq can provide unique information for better understanding health and diseases. One important application of the scRNA-seq technology is to build a better and high-resolution catalogue of cells in all living organism, commonly known as atlas, which is key resource to better understand and provide a solution in treating diseases. While great promises have been demonstrated with the technology in all areas, we further highlight a few remaining challenges to be overcome and its great potentials in transforming current protocols in disease diagnosis and treatment.,  This review provides a concise summary of the single-cell RNA sequencing technologies.Overview and guidelines for planning experimental procedures are presented.Bioinformatics tools for scRNA-seq data analysis are thoroughly discussed.Applications and further development of scRNA-seq technology are highlighted.},

Here, we demonstrate that the implantation of human iPS cell-derived cartilaginous tissue (hiPS-Cart) restores this loss by replacing lost NP spatially and functionally. NP cells consist of notochordal NP cells and chondrocyte-like NP cells. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis revealed that cells in hiPS-Cart corresponded to chondrocyte-like NP cells but not to notochordal NP cells. The implantation of hiPS-Cart into a nuclectomized space of IVD in nude rats prevented the degeneration of the IVD and preserved its mechanical properties. hiPS-Cart survived and occupied the nuclectomized space for at least six months after implantation, indicating spatial and functional replacement of lost NP by hiPS-Cart. Further scRNA-seq analysis revealed that hiPS-Cart cells changed their profile after implantation, differentiating into two lineages that are metabolically distinct from each other. However, post-implanted hiPS-Cart cells corresponded to chondrocyte-like NP cells only and did not develop into notochordal NP cells, suggesting that chondrocyte-like NP cells are nearly sufficient for NP function. The data collectively indicate that hiPS-Cart is a candidate implant for regenerating NP spatially and functionally and preventing IVD degeneration.},

This can have implications for epistemological access - access to knowledge that allows students to remain at university. Therefore, it is important to identify factors that may be causing this problem. We propose that one such factor may be differences in the structure of knowledge between the two levels. Therefore, this paper will assess some of the differences in the structuring of knowledge that exist between a high school and a university biology curriculum. To do this, a section of a high school and a university textbook which cover the same topic will be analysed using one aspect of Legitimation Code Theory called Semantics. Our findings suggest that there is a mismatch between the semantic range students are expected to navigate at university and that demanded by high school biology, and that this may pose a stumbling block to students gaining epistemological access to first-year study at university. If this is indeed the case, then pedagogic interventions which explicitly address this may contribute to improving undergraduate student retention and throughput rates at university.},

This expectation is based on the perceived success of such approaches in other parts of the world. At the same time, there has been a large investment in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) resources, and particularly in interactive whiteboard technology. This paper explores the idea of interactive teaching in relation to the interactive technology which might be used to support it. It explains the development of a framework for the detailed analysis of teaching and learning in activity settings which is designed to represent the features and relationships involved in interactivity. When applied to a case study of interactive teaching during a lesson involving a variety of technology-based activities, the framework reveals a confusion of purpose in students' use of an ICT resource that limits the potential for learning when students are working independently. Discussion of relationships between technical and pedagogical interactivity points a way forward concerning greater focus on learning goals during activity in order to enable learners to be more autonomous in exploiting ICT's affordances, and the conclusion identifies the variables and issues which need to be considered in future research which will illuminate this path.},

To address how interactions between four key TFs contribute to cis-regulation in mouse ESCs, we assayed two massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) libraries composed of binding sites for SOX2, POU5F1 (OCT4), KLF4, and ESRRB. Comparisons between synthetic cis-regulatory elements and genomic sequences with comparable binding site configurations revealed some aspects of a regulatory grammar. The expression of synthetic elements is influenced by both the number and arrangement of binding sites. This grammar plays only a small role for genomic sequences, as the relative activities of genomic sequences are best explained by the predicted occupancy of binding sites, regardless of binding site identity and positioning. Our results suggest that the effects of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are influenced by the order and orientation of sites, but that in the genome the overall occupancy of TFs is the primary determinant of activity.},

These mice also showed aberrant migration and differentiation of interneurons containing {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABAergic interneurons) in the ganglionic eminence and neocortex as well as abnormal testicular differentiation. These characteristics recapitulate some of the clinical features of X-linked lissencephaly with abnormal genitalia (XLAG) in humans. We found multiple loss-of-function mutations in ARX in individuals affected with XLAG and in some female relatives, and conclude that mutation of ARX causes XLAG.

We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after LIF withdrawal. The reproducibility of these high-throughput single cell data allowed us to deconstruct cell populations and infer gene expression relationships.},

At the same time, cognitive load theory stresses limitations of human cognitive architecture and urges educational developers to design learning tools that optimise learners' mental capacities. In a 2-month study we investigated university students' learning with an AI-enriched digital biology textbook that integrates a 5000-concept knowledge base and algorithms offering the possibility to ask questions and receive answers. The study aimed to shed more light on differences between three sub-types (intrinsic, germane and extraneous) of cognitive load and their relationship with learning gain, self-regulated learning and usability perception while students interacted with the AI-enriched book during an introductory biology course. We found that students displayed a beneficial learning pattern with germane cognitive load significantly higher than both intrinsic and extraneous loads showing that they were engaged in meaningful learning throughout the study. A significant correlation between germane load and accessing linked suggested questions available in the AI-book indicates that the book may support deep learning. Additionally, results showed that perceived non-optimal design, which deflects cognitive resources away from meaningful processing accompanied lower learning gains. Nevertheless, students reported substantially more favourable than unfavourable opinions of the AI-book. The findings provide new approaches for investigating cognitive load types in relation to learning with emerging digital tools in higher education. The findings also highlight the importance of optimally aligning educational technologies and human cognitive architecture.},

Students in the control group were asked to identify their demographic information before taking the test whereas students in the experimental group were asked to do so after completing the test. So, the control group was indirectly reminded of stereotypes before taking the test, when it could affect performance on the test, whereas the experimental group was reminded after the test when it could not affect test performance. Tests on two different loops were used, along with a partial cross-over design: a random group of students served as the control group on one test, and the experimental group on the other and vice versa. Mixed factor ANOVA analysis of the data showed that all the students scored significantly higher when not reminded of stereotypes before the test regardless of sex or race. In addition, average/below-average students scored significantly higher when not reminded of stereotypes before the test, again, regardless of sex or race. So, on harder topics in Computer Science, stereotype threat affects all the students, and in particular, the less-prepared students. In light of this, some suggestions are offered for avoiding stereotype threat during tests.},

Recent studies have shown that shadow enhancers are remarkably abundant and control most developmental gene expression in both invertebrates and vertebrates, including mammals. Shadow enhancers might provide an important mechanism for buffering gene expression against mutations in non-coding regulatory regions of genes implicated in human disease. Technological advances in genome editing and live imaging have shed light on how shadow enhancers establish precise gene expression patterns and confer phenotypic robustness. Shadow enhancers can interact in complex ways and may also help to drive the formation of transcriptional hubs within the nucleus. Despite their apparent redundancy, the prevalence and evolutionary conservation of shadow enhancers underscore their key role in emerging metazoan gene regulatory networks.},

Back pain affects more than half of people over the age of 65, and the treatment of back pain costs 50\textendash 100 billion dollars per year in the USA. The normal intervertebral disc is composed of three distinct regions: a thick outer ring of fibrous cartilage called the annulus fibrosus, a gel-like material that is surrounded by the annulus fibrosus called the nucleus pulposus, and superior and inferior cartilaginous end plates. The nucleus pulposus has been shown to be critical for disc health and function. Damage to this structure often leads to disc disease. Recent reports have demonstrated that the embryonic notochord, a rod-like structure present in the midline of vertebrate embryos, gives rise to all cell types found in adult nuclei pulposi. The mechanism responsible for the transformation of the notochord into nuclei pulposi is unknown. In this review, we discuss potential molecular and physical mechanisms that may be responsible for the notochord to nuclei pulposi transition.},

Potential mechanisms of transcriptional synergy are discussed with regard to enhancer structure and contemporary ChIP-sequencing assays, whereby just a small fraction of the observed binding sites represent bona fide regulatory DNAs.

However, even in this context, there were surprising instances of inequity. We measured inequity by documenting the distribution of students' questions, commands, and total talk within four pairs. Analysis revealed that less equitable pairs sought to complete tasks quickly and this may have led to patterns of marginalization and domination. Notably, this focus on speed was not evident in the more equitable pairs. These findings are important for understanding mechanisms of inequity and designing equitable collaboration practices in computer science.},

  abstract = {Early brain development requires a tight orchestration between neural tube patterning and growth. How pattern formation and brain growth are coordinated is incompletely understood. Previously we showed that aristaless-related homeobox (ARX), a paired-like transcription factor, regulates cortical progenitor pool expansion by repressing an inhibitor of cell cycle progression. Here we show that ARX participates in establishing dorsoventral identity in the mouse forebrain. In Arx mutant mice, ventral genes, including Olig2, are ectopically expressed dorsally. Furthermore, Gli1 is upregulated, suggesting an ectopic activation of SHH signaling. We show that the ectopic Olig2 expression can be repressed by blocking SHH signaling, implicating a role for SHH signaling in Olig2 induction. We further demonstrate that the ectopic Olig2 accounts for the reduced Pax6 and Tbr2 expression, both dorsal specific genes essential for cortical progenitor cell proliferation. These data suggest a link between the control of dorsoventral identity of progenitor cells and the control of their proliferation. In summary, our data demonstrate that ARX functions in a gene regulatory network integrating normal forebrain patterning and growth, providing important insight into how mutations in ARX can disrupt multiple aspects of brain development and thus generate a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes observed in human patients.},

  abstract = {In Drosophila melanogaster, cis-regulatory modules that are activated by the Notch cell\textendash cell signaling pathway all contain two types of transcription factor binding sites: those for the pathway's transducing factor Suppressor of Hairless [Su(H)] and those for one or more tissue- or cell type\textendash specific factors called ``local activators.'' The use of different ``Su(H) plus local activator'' motif combinations, or codes, is critical to ensure that only the correct subset of the broadly utilized Notch pathway's target genes are activated in each developmental context. However, much less is known about the role of enhancer ``architecture''\textemdash the number, order, spacing, and orientation of its component transcription factor binding motifs\textemdash in determining the module's specificity. Here we investigate the relationship between architecture and function for two Notch-regulated enhancers with spatially distinct activities, each of which includes five high-affinity Su(H) sites. We find that the first, which is active specifically in the socket cells of external sensory organs, is largely resistant to perturbations of its architecture. By contrast, the second enhancer, active in the ``non-SOP'' cells of the proneural clusters from which neural precursors arise, is sensitive to even simple rearrangements of its transcription factor binding sites, responding with both loss of normal specificity and striking ectopic activity. Thus, diverse cryptic specificities can be inherent in an enhancer's particular combination of transcription factor binding motifs. We propose that for certain types of enhancer, architecture plays an essential role in determining specificity, not only by permitting factor\textendash factor synergies necessary to generate the desired activity, but also by preventing other activator synergies that would otherwise lead to unwanted specificities.},

High-resolution chromosomal localization mapping of Brachyury by ChIP sequencing and ChIP-exonuclease revealed distinct sequence signatures enriched in Brachyury-bound enhancers. A combination of genome-wide in vitro and in vivo perturbation analysis and cross-species evolutionary comparison unveiled a detailed Brachyury-dependent gene-regulatory network that directly links the function of Brachyury to diverse developmental pathways and cellular housekeeping programs.

Previous research has shown that the flipped classroom model can motivate students towards active learning, can improve their higher-order thinking skills, and can improve their collaborative learning skills. However, most current studies focus on students' experiences with flipped classroom learning. Because so few studies address the instructor's perspective, and instructors' perspectives on technology integration can directly influence their practice of incorporating technology in instruction, this study sought to focus on instructors. This paper is a qualitative case study that reveals instructors' experiences and perspectives on using the flipped classroom model in instruction. Structured interviews were conducted with eight faculty members who either previously had used or planned to use the flipped classroom model. Findings include instructors' perceived definitions of the flipped classroom, how they improved teaching and learning by using the flipped classroom model, their perceived benefits and challenges of the flipped classroom, and perceived approaches of using it in an effective way. The participants also recommended peer assistance among instructors as valuable support to implement the flipped classroom model in instruction successfully.},

To investigate how cells integrate information from extrinsic and intrinsic inputs, we examined Brachyury (Hr-Bra) promoter activity in the early embryo. Hr-Bra, which encodes a key transcription factor for notochord development, is expressed exclusively in notochord precursors in a manner dependent on the FGF-MEK-MAPK-Ets signaling pathway and on the intrinsic factors Zic and FoxA. Reporter gene expression driven by the 900-bp upstream region of the Hr-Bra promoter was detected as early as the 110-cell stage in notochord precursors by in situ hybridization with a LacZ probe. Deletion analysis combined with MEK inhibitor treatment demonstrated that the -598/-499 region carries FGF-responsiveness. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay identified three Ets-binding sites in this region that were required for promoter activity. Further deletion analysis conducted by injecting eggs with reporter constructs at higher concentration suggested that the -398/-289 region also has enhancer activity, although ectopic reporter expression was detected in nerve cord and endoderm precursors. The -398/-289 region has a Zic-binding site that was also essential for the enhancer activity. These results indicate that Ets- and Zic-binding sites are critical for the initiation of Hr-Bra expression. In conclusion, information from both extrinsic and intrinsic factors is integrated at the level of enhancer of the target gene by direct binding of the transcription factors to the enhancer region.},

More recently these factors have been characterized, identified, and used therapeutically to induce repair upon injured IVDs in small and large pre-clinical animal models. Further, notochordal cell-rich IVD NPs maintain a stable, healthy extracellular matrix whereas notochordal cell-deficient IVDs result in a biomechanically and extracellular matrix defective phenotype.

Exams were constructed to contain both transfer and retention questions. Abstraction learners demonstrated better performance than exemplar learners on the transfer questions but not on the retention questions. These results were not moderated by indices of crystallized or fluid intelligence. Our central interpretation is that students identified as abstraction learners appear to construct a deep understanding of the concepts (presumably based on abstract underpinnings), thereby enabling them to apply and generalize the concepts to scenarios and instantiations not seen during instruction (transfer questions). By contrast, other students appear to base their representations on memorized instructed examples, leading to good performance on retention questions but not transfer questions.},

However, despite its promises, their adoption in educational institutions is slow. There are many barriers to the adoption of OER, and many are from within the community of OER advocates. This commentary calls for a wider discussion to remove these barriers to mainstreaming OER in teaching and learning and argues for a rethinking of the idea of `open' to make it more inclusive by redefining the concept. It reminds us of the original thinking behind OER \textendash{} which was to create universally available educational resources that can improve the quality of teaching and learning. This commentary posits arguments against conflating OER and open education, questions the narrow definitions of OER, and raises issues around how to be more flexible and open to mainstreaming OER and removing barriers from within the OER movement.},

This gene was designated Arx (aristaless related homeobox gene) in consideration of its structural similarity to the al gene. Arx was highly conserved between mouse and zebrafish. Neuromeric expression in the forebrain and longitudinal expression in the floor plate were observed in mouse and zebrafish. The expression of Arx in the ganglionic eminence and ventral thalamus overlapped regionally with that of Dlx1, but the cell layer where Arx is expressed differed from that of the Dlx1. This gene was also found to be expressed in the dorsal telencephalon (presumptive cerebral cortex) of mouse embryos. The structure and expression pattern of Arx with respect to any possible relationship to al and Dlx1, as well as the function of Arx in the floor plate are discussed.},

  abstract = {Intervertebral discs are cartilaginous joints present between vertebrae. The centers of the intervertebral discs consist of a gelatinous nucleus pulposus derived from the embryonic notochord. With age or injury, intervertebral discs may degenerate, causing neurological symptoms including back pain, which affects millions of people worldwide. Back pain is a multifactorial disorder, and disc degeneration is one of the primary contributing factors. Recent studies in mice have identified the key molecules involved in the formation of intervertebral discs. Several of these key molecules including sonic hedgehog and Brachyury are not only expressed by notochord during development, but are also expressed by neonatal mouse nucleus pulposus cells, and are crucial for postnatal disc maintenance. These findings suggest that intrinsic signals in each disc may maintain the nucleus pulposus microenvironment. However, since expression of these developmental signals declines with age and degeneration, disc degeneration may be related to the loss of these intrinsic signals. In addition, findings from mouse and other mammalian models have identified similarities between the patterning capabilities of the embryonic notochord and young nucleus pulposus cells, suggesting that mouse is a suitable model system to understand disc development and aging. Future research aimed at understanding the upstream regulators of these developmental signals and the modes by which they regulate disc growth and maintenance will likely provide mechanistic insights into disc growth and aging. Further, such findings will likely provide insights relevant to the development of effective therapies for treatment of back pain and reversing the disc degenerative process.

Researchers have developed a framework for a computer science growth mindset classroom, which includes faculty development, lesson plans, and vocabulary for use with students. In addition, the faculty have formed a community of practice which identifies areas where growth mindset techniques can be used and has implemented these strategies in their classrooms. The framework and materials developed are presented here, with early results from this ongoing work. The objective is to determine if faculty development on growth mindset and active use of the framework for a growth mindset classroom results in superior academic outcomes in CS0 and CS1.

Since acquisition of a tadpole-like tail during tailbud stage is one of the key events in the evolution of chordates, understanding the anatomy of the tailbud stage chordate embryo is of special interest. In this study, to understand comprehensively the anatomy of the tailbud embryo at single-cell-level, real microscopic image stacks of the tailbud embryo in Ciona intestinalis were reconstructed into a 3D computer model. This comprehensive 3D model of the ascidian tailbud embryo was based on real images of confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and therefore, cell shape, location and cell arrangement reflect real geometries of the tailbud embryo. We found that the tailbud embryo consists of 1579 cells, including 836 epidermal cells, 228 cells in the central nervous system, 218 mesenchymal cells, four trunk ventral cells, two B/B⁎8.11 cells, 36 muscle cells, 40 notochord cells, four primordial germ cells, and 199 endodermal cells. Moreover, we identified for the first time two populations of previously undefined cells (a total of 12 cells) in Ciona: one located in the lateral trunk and the other located under the tail dorsal epidermis. This information provides a first step for understanding how the body plan of the chordate tailbud embryo formed and evolved.},

  abstract = {Chordoma is a rare, but often malignant, bone cancer that preferentially affects the axial skeleton and the skull base. These tumors are both sporadic and hereditary and appear to occur more frequently after the fourth decade of life; however, modern technologies have increased the detection of pediatric chordomas. Chordomas originate from remnants of the notochord, the main embryonic axial structure that precedes the backbone, and share with notochord cells both histological features and the expression of characteristic genes. One such gene is Brachyury, which encodes for a sequence-specific transcription factor. Known for decades as a main regulator of notochord formation, Brachyury has recently gained interest as a biomarker and causative agent of chordoma, and therefore as a promising therapeutic target. Here, we review the main characteristics of chordoma, the molecular markers, and the clinical approaches currently available for the early detection and possible treatment of this cancer. In particular, we report on the current knowledge of the role of Brachyury and of its possible mechanisms of action in both notochord formation and chordoma etiogenesis.},

  abstract = {Divergent morphology of species has largely been ascribed to genetic differences in the tissue-specific expression of proteins, which could be achieved by divergence in cis-regulatory elements or by altering the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs). The relative importance of the latter has been difficult to assess, as previous systematic analyses of TF binding specificity have been performed using different methods in different species. To address this, we determined the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs, and compared them to human and mouse data. This analysis revealed that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, and that for orthologous TFs, the similarity extends even to the level of very subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.           ,              Flies look very different from humans, but both are descended from a common ancestor that existed over 600 million years ago. Some differences between animal species are due to them having different genes: stretches of DNA that contain the instructions to make proteins and other molecules. However, often differences are caused by the same or similar genes being switched on and off at different times and in different tissues in each species.             The instructions that control when and where a gene is expressed are written in the sequence of DNA bases located in the regulatory region of the gene. These instructions are written in a language that is often called the `gene regulatory code'. This code is read and interpreted by proteins called transcription factors that bind to specific sequences of DNA (or `DNA words') and increase or decrease gene expression. Changes in gene expression between species could therefore be due to changes in the transcription factors and/or changes in the instructions within the regulatory regions of specific genes.             Gene regulatory regions are not well conserved between species. However, it is unclear if the instructions in these regions are written using the same gene regulatory code, and whether transcription factors found in different species recognize different DNA words.             Nitta et al. have now used high-throughput methods to identify the DNA words recognized by 242 transcription factors from a fruit fly called Drosophila melanogaster. Nitta et al. then used new computational tools to find motifs, or collections of DNA words, that are recognized by each of the transcription factors. By comparing the motifs, they observed that, in spite of more than 600 million years of evolution, almost all known motifs found in humans and mice were recognized by fruit fly transcription factors.             Nitta et al. noted that both fruit flies and humans have transcription factors that recognize a few unique motifs, and confer properties that are specific to each species. For example, some of the transcription factors that control the development of the fruit fly wing are not present in humans. Moreover, fruit flies lack both mucus-producing goblet cells and the ability to recognize a motif read by the transcription factor that controls the development of these cells in humans.             The findings of Nitta et al. also indicate that transcription factors do not evolve to recognize subtly different DNA motifs, but instead appear constrained to recognize the same motifs. Thus, much like the genetic code that instructs how to build proteins, the gene regulatory code that determines how DNA sequences direct gene expression is also highly conserved in animals. The language used to guide the development of animals has, as such, remained very similar for millions of years. What makes animals different is differences in the content and length of the instructions that are written using this language into the regulatory regions of their genes.},

The opportunity to study entire transcriptomes in great detail using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has fueled many important discoveries and is now a routine method in biomedical research. However, RNA-seq is typically performed in ``bulk,'' and the data represent an average of gene expression patterns across thousands to millions of cells; this might obscure biologically relevant differences between cells. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) represents an approach to overcome this problem. By isolating single cells, capturing their transcripts, and generating sequencing libraries in which the transcripts are mapped to individual cells, scRNA-seq allows assessment of fundamental biological properties of cell populations and biological systems at unprecedented resolution. Here, we present the most common scRNA-seq protocols in use today and the basics of data analysis and discuss factors that are important to consider before planning and designing an scRNA-seq project. \textcopyright{} 2018 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

It is thus leading us towards the ``big data'' era which is creating a pressing need to bridge the gap between high-throughput technological development and our ability for managing, analyzing, and integrating the biological big data. To harness the maximum out of it, sufficient expertise needs to be developed for big data management and analysis.

These factors bind cooperatively to the IFN-{$\beta$} enhancer and recruit coactivators and chromatin-remodeling proteins to the~IFN-{$\beta$} promoter. We describe here a crystal structure of the DNA-binding domains of IRF-3, IRF-7, and NF{$\kappa$}B, bound to one half of the enhancer, and use a previously described structure of the remaining half to assemble a complete picture of enhanceosome architecture in the vicinity of~the DNA. Association of eight proteins with the enhancer creates a continuous surface for~recognizing a composite DNA-binding element. Paucity of local protein-protein contacts suggests that cooperative occupancy of the enhancer comes from both binding-induced changes in DNA conformation and interactions with additional components such as CBP. Contacts with virtually every nucleotide pair account for the evolutionary invariance of the enhancer sequence.},

The students involved in the study have only minimal experience with big-O analysis, discussed within the first two introductory computer science classes. During these hour-long interviews, the students were asked to analyze code or a paragraph to find the runtime of the algorithm involved and invited students to write code that would in a certain runtime. From these interactions, we conclude that students that have difficulties with big-O could be having trouble with the mathematical function used in the analysis and/or the techniques they used to solve the problem.},

  abstract = {Muscular dystrophy is frequently caused by disruption of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC), which links muscle cells to the extracellular matrix. Dystroglycan, a central component of the DGC, serves as a laminin receptor via its extracellular {$\alpha$} subunit, and interacts with dystrophin (and thus the actin cytoskeleton) through its integral membrane {$\beta$} subunit. We have removed the function of dystroglycan in zebrafish embryos. In contrast to mouse, where dystroglycan mutations lead to peri-implantation lethality, dystroglycan is dispensable for basement membrane formation during early zebrafish development. At later stages, however, loss of dystroglycan leads to a disruption of the DGC, concurrent with loss of muscle integrity and necrosis. In addition, we find that loss of the DGC leads to loss of sarcomere and sarcoplasmic reticulum organisation. The DGC is required for long-term survival of muscle cells in zebrafish, but is dispensable for muscle formation. Dystroglycan or the DGC is also required for normal sarcomere and sarcoplasmic reticulum organisation. Because zebrafish embryos lacking dystroglycan share several characteristics with human muscular dystrophy, they should serve as a useful model for the disease. In addition, knowing the dystroglycan null phenotype in zebrafish will facilitate the isolation of other molecules involved in muscular dystrophy pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {The notochord is a defining feature of the chordate body plan. Experiments in ascidian, frog and mouse embryos have shown that co-expression of Brachyury and FoxA class transcription factors is required for notochord development. However, studies on the cis-regulatory sequences mediating the synergistic effects of these transcription factors are complicated by the limited knowledge of notochord genes and cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that are directly targeted by both. We have identified an easily testable model for such investigations in a 155-bp notochord-specific CRM from the ascidian Ciona intestinalis. This CRM contains functional binding sites for both Ciona Brachyury (Ci-Bra) and FoxA (Ci-FoxA-a). By combining point mutation analysis and misexpression experiments, we demonstrate that binding of both transcription factors to this CRM is necessary and sufficient to activate transcription. To gain insights into the cis-regulatory criteria controlling its activity, we investigated the organization of the transcription factor binding sites within the 155-bp CRM. The 155-bp sequence contains two Ci-Bra binding sites with identical core sequences but opposite orientations, only one of which is required for enhancer activity. Changes in both orientation and spacing of these sites substantially affect the activity of the CRM, as clusters of identical sites found in the Ciona genome with different arrangements are unable to activate transcription in notochord cells. This work presents the first evidence of a synergistic interaction between Brachyury and FoxA in the activation of an individual notochord CRM,and highlights the importance of transcription factor binding site arrangement for its function.},

Usually localized through neurological history, exam, and imaging, specific signs and symptoms for lumbar radicular, spinal stenosis, and cervical radicular pain can help determine etiology. Once radicular back pain has been diagnosed, a multitude of treatment options are available from rest and physical therapy to medications, epidurals, and surgery. The most common and accepted are reviewed. With accurate diagnosis, safe and effective pain management can be employed to shorten radicular episodes and manage recurrent or chronic radicular syndromes.

  abstract = {Asymmetric cell divisions produce two sibling cells with distinct fates,providing an important means of generating cell diversity in developing embryos. Many examples of such cell divisions have been described, but so far only a limited number of the underlying mechanisms have been elucidated. Here,we have uncovered a novel mechanism controlling an asymmetric cell division in the ascidian embryo. This division produces one notochord and one neural precursor. Differential activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase(ERK) between the sibling cells determines their distinct fates, with ERK activation promoting notochord fate. We first demonstrate that the segregation of notochord and neural fates is an autonomous property of the mother cell and that the mother cell acquires this functional polarity via interactions with neighbouring ectoderm precursors. We show that these cellular interactions are mediated by the ephrin-Eph signalling system, previously implicated in controlling cell movement and adhesion. Disruption of contacts with the signalling cells or inhibition of the ephrin-Eph signal results in the symmetric division of the mother cell, generating two notochord precursors. Finally, we demonstrate that the ephrin-Eph signal acts via attenuation of ERK activation in the neural-fated daughter cell. We propose a model whereby directional ephrin-Eph signals functionally polarise the notochord/neural mother cell, leading to asymmetric modulation of the FGF-Ras-ERK pathway between the daughter cells and, thus, to their differential fate specification.},

Identifying and addressing students' misconceptions is a key part of a computer science teacher's competence. However, relevant research on this topic is not as fully developed in the computer science education field as it is in mathematics and science education. In this article, we first review relevant literature on general definitions of misconceptions and studies about students' misconceptions and other difficulties in introductory programming. Next, we investigate the factors that contribute to the difficulties. Finally, strategies and tools to address difficulties including misconceptions are discussed. Based on the review of literature, we found that students exhibit various misconceptions and other difficulties in syntactic knowledge, conceptual knowledge, and strategic knowledge. These difficulties experienced by students are related to many factors including unfamiliarity of syntax, natural language, math knowledge, inaccurate mental models, lack of strategies, programming environments, and teachers' knowledge and instruction. However, many sources of students' difficulties have connections with students' prior knowledge. To better understand and address students' misconceptions and other difficulties, various instructional approaches and tools have been developed. Nevertheless, the dissemination of these approaches and tools has been limited. Thus, first, we suggest enhancing the dissemination of existing tools and approaches and investigating their long-term effects. Second, we recommend that computing education research move beyond documenting misconceptions to address the development of students' (mis)conceptions by integrating conceptual change theories. Third, we believe that developing and enhancing instructors' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), including their knowledge of students' misconceptions and ability to apply effective instructional approaches and tools to address students' difficulties, is vital to the success of teaching introductory programming.},

  abstract = {{$\blacksquare$} Abstract: This review article describes anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology and treatment of intervertebral disc. The intervertebral discs lie between the vertebral bodies, linking them together. The components of the disc are nucleus pulposus, annulus fibrosus and cartilagenous end-plates. The blood supply to the disc is only to the cartilagenous end-plates. The nerve supply is basically through the sinovertebral nerve. Biochemically, the important constituents of the disc are collagen fibers, elastin fibers and aggrecan. As the disc ages, degeneration occurs, osmotic pressure is lost in the nucleus, dehydration occurs, and the disc loses its height. During these changes, nociceptive nuclear material tracks and leaks through the outer rim of the annulus. This is the main source of discogenic pain. While this is occurring, the degenerative disc, having lost its height, effects the structures close by, such as ligamentum flavum, facet joints, and the shape of the neural foramina. This is the main cause of spinal stenosis and radicular pain due to the disc degeneration in the aged populations. Diagnosis is done by a strict protocol and treatment options are described in this review. The rationale for new therapies are to substitute the biochemical constituents, or augment nucleus pulposus or regenerate cartilaginous end-plate or finally artificial disc implantation. {$\blacksquare$}.},

Here, we perform RNAseq on flow-sorted notochord cells from multiple stages to define a comprehensive Ciona notochord transcriptome. We identify 1364 genes with enriched expression and extensively validate the results by in situ hybridization. These genes are highly enriched for Gene Ontology terms related to the extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton. Orthologs of 112 of the Ciona notochord genes have known notochord expression in vertebrates, more than twice as many as predicted by chance alone. This set of putative effector genes with notochord expression conserved from tunicates to vertebrates will be invaluable for testing hypotheses about notochord evolution. The full set of Ciona notochord genes provides a foundation for systems-level studies of notochord gene regulation and morphogenesis. We find only modest overlap between this set of notochord-enriched transcripts and the genes upregulated by ectopic expression of the key notochord transcription factor Brachyury, indicating that Brachyury is not a notochord master regulator gene as strictly defined.},

The transcription factor Brachyury (Bra) is a key regulator of notochord fate but here we show that it is not a unitary master regulator in the model chordate Ciona. Ectopic Bra expression only partially reprograms other cell types to a notochord-like transcriptional profile and a subset of notochord-enriched genes is unaffected by CRISPR Bra disruption. We identify Foxa.a and Mnx as potential co-regulators, and find that combinatorial cocktails are more effective at reprogramming other cell types than Bra alone. We reassess the network relationships between Bra, Foxa.a and other components of the notochord gene regulatory network, and find that Foxa.a expression in the notochord is regulated by vegetal FGF signaling. It is a direct activator of Bra expression and has a binding motif that is significantly enriched in the regulatory regions of notochord-enriched genes. These and other results indicate that Bra and Foxa.a act together in a regulatory network dominated by positive feed-forward interactions, with neither being a classically defined master regulator.},

We used Ciona tissue-specific enhancers to drive expression of spectrally distinct fluorescent protein reporters to label and simultaneously visualize axially and paraxially positioned mesodermal derivatives, as well as neural precursors in individual embryos. We observed morphogenetic movements, without perturbing development, from the early gastrula throughout the larval stage, including gastrulation, neurulation, convergent extension of the presumptive notochord, and tail elongation. These multidimensional data allowed us to establish a reference system of metrics to quantify key developmental events including blastopore closure and muscle extension. The approach we describe can be used to document morphogenetic cell and tissue rearrangements in living embryos and paves the way for a live digitized anatomical atlas of Ciona. genesis 43:136\textendash 147, 2005.},

Our analysis extends the traditional use of learning curve analysis to include less structured data, and also reveals new possibilities for when to teach students new programming concepts. One particular discovery is that while we find evidence of student learning in some cases (for example, in function definitions and comparisons), there are other programming elements which do not demonstrate typical learning. In those cases, we discuss how further changes to the model could affect both demonstrated learning and our understanding of the different concepts that students learn.},

In this work, the established Clance IP Scale is used to identify the prevalence of IP among graduate and undergraduate computer science students at a large research-intensive North American institution. Among this population of over 200 students, 57\% were found to exhibit frequent feelings of the Impostor Phenomenon with a larger fraction of women (71\%) experiencing frequent feelings of the Imposter Phenomenon than men (52\%). Additionally, IP was found to have greater prevalence among computer science students than among students of other populations from comparable studies. Due to the negative impacts associated with feelings of the Impostor Phenomenon, computer science education should work to improve student awareness and help student cope with these feelings.},

A molecular cascade is emerging for the mesendoderm, but less is known about the ectoderm, giving rise to epidermis and nervous tissue. Our cis-regulatory analysis surprisingly places the maternal transcription factor Ci-GATAa(GATA4/5/6) at the top of the ectodermal regulatory network in ascidians. Initially distributed throughout the embryo, Ci-GATAa activity is progressively repressed in vegetal territories by accumulating maternal{$\beta$}-catenin. Once restricted to the animal hemisphere, Ci-GATAa directly activates two types of zygotic ectodermal genes. First, Ci-fog is activated from the 8-cell stage throughout the ectoderm, then Ci-otxis turned on from the 32-cell stage in neural precursors only. Whereas the enhancers of both genes contain critical and interchangeable GATA sites, their distinct patterns of activation stem from the additional presence of two Ets sites in the Ci-otx enhancer. Initially characterized as activating elements in the neural lineages, these Ets sites additionally act as repressors in non-neural lineages, and restrict GATA-mediated activation of Ci-otx. We thus identify a precise combinatorial code of maternal factors responsible for zygotic onset of a chordate ectodermal genetic program.},

The design, structure, and content of our course are influenced by recent efforts in this area, collaborations with life scientists, and our own instructional experience. Specifically, we suggest that an effective course of this nature should: (1) devote time to explicitly reflect upon computational thinking processes, resisting the temptation to drift to purely practical instruction, (2) focus on discrete notions, rather than on continuous ones, and (3) have basic programming as a prerequisite, so students need not be preoccupied with elementary programming issues. We strongly recommend that the mere use of existing bioinformatics tools and packages should not replace hands-on programming. Yet, we suggest that programming will mostly serve as a means to practice computational thinking processes. This paper deals with the challenges and considerations of such computational education for life science students. It also describes a concrete implementation of the course and encourages its use by others.},

Because enhancers are critical for development, and the majority of disease-associated mutations reside within enhancers, it is essential to understand which sequences within enhancers are important for function. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the rapid generation of genomic data that predict putative active enhancers, but functionally validating these sequences at scale remains a fundamental challenge. Herein, we discuss the power of genome-wide strategies used to identify candidate enhancers, and also highlight limitations and misconceptions that have arisen from these data. We discuss the use of massively parallel reporter assays to test enhancers for function at scale. We also review recent advances in our ability to study gene regulation during development, including CRISPR-based tools to manipulate genomes and single-cell transcriptomics to finely map gene expression. Finally, we look ahead to a synthesis of complementary genomic approaches that will advance our understanding of enhancer function during development.

The T-box transcription factor brachyury (T) is essential for both formation of the notochord and maintenance of NMPs, and thus is a key regulator of trunk and tail development. The T promoter controlling T expression in NMPs and nascent mesoderm has been characterized in detail; however, control elements for T expression in the notochord have not been identified yet. We have generated a series of deletion alleles by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in mESCs, and analyzed their effects in mutant mouse embryos. We identified a 37\hspace{0.25em}kb region upstream of T that is essential for notochord function and tailbud outgrowth. Within that region, we discovered a T-binding enhancer required for notochord cell specification and differentiation. Our data reveal a complex regulatory landscape controlling cell type-specific expression and function of T in NMP/nascent mesoderm and node/notochord, allowing proper trunk and tail development.},

  abstract = {A new quality of learning and teaching in general, is an absolute priority for education. The teachers are not only sources of information, they are also meant to lead managers and teaching so as to develop the interaction among students and training/development of key social personality traits. The students want to understand natural phenomena, to know scientific truths and to acquire knowledge to be applied in practice and for these reasons they are dissatisfied by the traditional education. The teachers and students, in most universities that have used the traditional lecture in courses, have revealed t he limited effectiveness in both teaching and learning. The teacher must use methods to encourage discovery learning, heuristic and research methods. Dynamic and communicative teaching methods, also called interactive teaching methods, constitute the basic elements of a recently developed process to motivate learning, so that the students and future engineers develop a critical position about the taught content. Using interactive techniques and strategies, the students become more engaged in learning; retain more information, thus becoming more satisfied.},

The Ciona intestinalis connectome has been recently mapped, revealing the smallest central nervous system (CNS) known in any chordate, with only 177 neurons. This minimal CNS is highly reminiscent of larger CNS of vertebrates, sharing many conserved developmental processes, anatomical compartments, neuron subtypes, and even specific neural circuits. Thus, the Ciona tadpole offers a unique opportunity to understand the development and wiring of a chordate CNS at single-cell resolution. Here we report the use of single-cell RNAseq to profile the transcriptomes of single cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from the whole brain of Ciona robusta (formerly intestinalis Type A) larvae. We have also compared these profiles to bulk RNAseq data from specific subsets of brain cells isolated by FACS using cell type-specific reporter plasmid expression. Taken together, these datasets have begun to reveal the compartment- and cell-specific gene expression patterns that define the organization of the Ciona larval brain.},

  abstract = {A major goal in biology is to understand the rules by which cis-regulatory sequences control spatially and temporally precise expression patterns. Here we present a systematic dissection of the proximal enhancer for the notochord-specific transcription factor               brachyury               in the ascidian chordate               Ciona               . The study uses a quantitative image-based reporter assay that incorporates a dual-reporter strategy to control for variable electroporation efficiency. We identified and mutated multiple predicted transcription factor binding sites of interest based on statistical matches to the JASPAR binding motif database. Most sites (Zic, Ets, FoxA, RBPJ) were selected based on prior knowledge of cell fate specification in both the primary and secondary notochord. We also mutated predicted Brachyury sites to investigate potential autoregulation as well as Fos/Jun (AP1) sites that had very strong matches to JASPAR. Our goal was to quantitatively define the relative importance of these different sites, to explore the importance of predicted high-affinity versus low-affinity motifs, and to attempt to design mutant enhancers that were specifically expressed in only the primary or secondary notochord lineages. We found that the mutation of all predicted high-affinity sites for Zic, FoxA or Ets led to quantifiably distinct effects. The FoxA construct caused a severe loss of reporter expression whereas the Ets construct had little effect. A strong Ets phenotype was only seen when much lower-scoring binding sites were also mutated. This supports the enhancer suboptimization hypothesis proposed by Farley and Levine but suggests that it may only apply to some but not all transcription factor families. We quantified reporter expression separately in the two notochord lineages with the expectation that Ets mutations and RBPJ mutations would have distinct effects given that primary notochord is induced by Ets-mediated FGF signaling whereas secondary notochord is induced by RBPJ/Su(H)-mediated Notch/Delta signaling. We found, however, that ETS mutations affected primary and secondary notochord expression relatively equally and that RBPJ mutations were only moderately more severe in their effect on secondary versus primary notochord. Our results point to the promise of quantitative reporter assays for understanding cis-regulatory logic but also highlight the challenge of arbitrary statistical thresholds for predicting potentially important sites.},

To better understand why few students with disabilities pursue PhDs in computing and related fields, we conducted an interview study with 19 current and former graduate students who identified as blind or low vision, or deaf or hard of hearing. We asked participants about challenges or barriers they encountered in graduate school. We asked about accommodations they received, or did not receive, and about different forms of support. We found that a wide range of inaccessibility issues in research, courses, and in managing accommodations impacted student progress. Contributions from this work include identifying two forms of access inequality that emerged: (1) access differential: the gap between the access that non/disabled students experience, and (2) inequitable access: the degree of inadequacy of existing accommodations to address inaccessibility.},

Unbiased transcriptome data analysis mapped each cell's physical position and lineage history, yielding the complete history of gene expression at the genome-wide level for every single cell in a developing embryo. A comparison of individual embryos reveals both extensive reproducibility between symmetric embryo sides and a large inter-embryonic variability due to small differences in embryogenesis timing.},

Readers will learn about the most robust ideas in education research, which serve as jumping off points in their new forays into the realm of discipline-based education research. Quantitative, interpretive, and action research methods are introduced with real-life, easy to follow examples. The authors, long-time contributors to the science education community, provide rubber-meets-the-road guidance to both first-time and experienced researchers, to get projects off the ground with the goals of improving classroom practice and contributing to the knowledge base on the teaching and learning of science.Discipline-based education research is much like traditional scientific research in that using different instruments sometimes results in unexpected answers. As an example, the cover image uniquely reveals vastly different information about flowers when viewed in visible light (upper left) and in ultraviolet light (lower right). In much the same way, carefully planned and well executed discipline-based education research using a variety of research lenses has the ability to yield unexpected insight into teaching and learning that can benefit all of us.},

Gastrulation involves four evolutionarily conserved morphogenetic movements, each of which results in a specific morphologic transformation. During emboly, mesodermal and endodermal cells become internalized beneath the ectoderm. Epibolic movements spread and thin germ layers. Convergence movements narrow germ layers dorsoventrally, while concurrent extension movements elongate them anteroposteriorly. Each gastrulation movement can be achieved by single or multiple motile cell behaviors, including cell shape changes, directed migration, planar and radial intercalations, and cell divisions. Recent studies delineate cyclical and ratchet-like behaviors of the actomyosin cytoskeleton as a common mechanism underlying various gastrulation cell behaviors. Gastrulation movements are guided by differential cell adhesion, chemotaxis, chemokinesis, and planar polarity. Coordination of gastrulation movements with embryonic polarity involves regulation by anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning systems of planar polarity signaling, expression of chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules.},

  abstract = {The notochord is a key structure during chordate development. We have previously identified several enhancers regulated by Zic and ETS that encode notochord activity within the marine chordate Ciona robusta (Ciona). To better understand the role of Zic and ETS within notochord enhancers, we tested 90 genomic elements containing Zic and ETS sites for expression in developing Ciona embryos using a whole-embryo, massively parallel reporter assay. We discovered that 39/90 of the elements were active in developing embryos; however only 10\% were active within the notochord, indicating that more than just Zic and ETS sites are required for notochord expression. Further analysis revealed notochord enhancers were regulated by three groups of factors: (1) Zic and ETS, (2) Zic, ETS and Brachyury (Bra), and (3) Zic, ETS, Bra and FoxA. One of these notochord enhancers, regulated by Zic and ETS, is located upstream of laminin alpha, a gene critical for notochord development in both Ciona and vertebrates. Reversing the ETS sites in this enhancer greatly diminish expression, indicating that enhancer grammar is critical for enhancer activity. Strikingly, we find clusters of Zic and ETS binding sites within the introns of mouse and human laminin alpha 1 with conserved enhancer grammar. Our analysis also identified two notochord enhancers regulated by Zic, ETS, FoxA and Bra binding sites: the Bra Shadow (BraS) enhancer located in close proximity to Bra, and an enhancer located near the gene Lrig. Randomizing the BraS enhancer demonstrates that although the Zic and ETS sites are necessary for enhancer activity, they are not sufficient. We find that FoxA and Bra sites contribute to BraS enhancer activity. Zic, ETS, FoxA and Bra binding sites occur within the Ciona Bra434 enhancer and vertebrate notochord Brachyury enhancers, suggesting a conserved regulatory logic. Collectively, this study deepens our understanding of how enhancers encode notochord expression, illustrates the importance of enhancer grammar, and hints at the conservation of enhancer logic and grammar across chordates.},

  abstract = {Successful ingroup members can act as identity-safety cues (i.e., cues suggesting one's identities are valued in an organization); however, Black women often lack opportunities to learn about employees matching their gender and race. Group level theories on stigma solidarity suggest Black women would expect a Latina employee to face similar discrimination and thus, would identify with her and believe she holds positive stereotypes about Black women, which are both important precursors to identity-safety. Testing this possibility across two studies and an internal meta-analysis, we explored whether Latina employees functioned as identity-safety cues for Black women. Given the intragroup variability among Latinas, we also examined the importance of Latina employees' racial phenotype. We found that Black female participants were equally likely to believe that a White-Latina, Afro-Latina, and Black female employee had faced bias generally (Studies 1 and 2) and encountered more bias relative to a White female employee (Study 1). However, participants only believed the Afro-Latina experienced similar levels of such bias (i.e., quantitively similar bias; Studies 1 and 2) and promoted belonging and interest at the company at a similar rate to the Black woman. In Study 2, we manipulated shared discrimination by having the employees disclose (or not disclose) past encounters with racism and found that this manipulation enhanced identification with the White-Latina and expectations she held positive stereotypes about Black women. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the importance of recognizing intragroup variability when examining identity-safety cues and shared discrimination as critical mechanisms underlying positive outgroup member perceptions. This paper presents two studies which address an underdeveloped area within acculturation research: majority members' perceptions of cultural change. Specifically, drawing on the theory of cultural inertia, we explored how majority members react to perceptions of recent majority culture and minority cultures change. A path model was hypothesised whereby British and English majority members' perceptions that their British (Study 1, N = 266) and English (Study 2, N = 292) cultures are changing due to the presence of minority cultures was positively associated with symbolic threat, and through this with greater prejudice towards minorities living in the UK/England. However, participants' perceptions that minority cultures are changing due to influence from the majority culture were negatively associated with symbolic threat, and through this with less prejudice towards minorities. These findings were supported across different operationalizations of prejudice (i.e., social distance and positive/negative affect) and even when controlling for another recently introduced concept of meta-perceptions \textendash{} that is, majority members' perceptions of whether minority members prefer majority members to maintain their culture and/or adopt to the minority cultures. Findings call for a greater focus on studying the intergroup consequences of majority members' perceptions of cultural change. The transition to secondary school involves a host of new challenges that often lead to declines in students' motivation and achievement. This study examined whether test anxiety contributes to the changes in academic self-concept, expectations of success, task values and achievement in the two core domains of mathematics and language arts among 478 students (247 girls, Mean ageT1 = 12.15) as they transition to secondary school. To evaluate the generalizability of the results to male and female students, gender differences were also examined. The results of path analyses revealed that for both genders, test anxiety played a mediational role in the changes in academic self-concept before and after the transition. In addition, test anxiety partially mediated the changes between prior and later expectations of success and achievement, but only for girls in mathematics. These findings highlight that students with lower levels of motivation and achievement at the end of elementary school, especially girls in the domain of mathematics, are more at risk to face a difficult transition to secondary school. The social consequences of obesity may influence health and mortality rate (MR), given obesity's status as a highly stigmatized condition. Hence, a high absolute body mass index (BMI) in conjunction with the stigmatization of a high BMI may each independently increase the rate of MR. We tested whether relative BMI, defined as ordinal rank within a social reference group jointly defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, is associated with MR independent of absolute BMI. Data were from three nationally representative datasets: the Health and Retirement Study (n = 31,115), the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS, n = 529,362), and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 45,033). Relative BMI kg/m2 deciles were calculated within twenty-four subgroups jointly defined by age (6 levels), sex (2 levels), and race/ethnicity (4 levels). The association between ordinal rank BMI and MR was assessed using Cox survival generalized additive models in each dataset with adjustments for age, race, sex, smoking, educational attainment, and absolute BMI. Absolute BMI had a significant non-monotonic association with MR, such that BMI was positively associated with mortality at BMI levels above approximately 25 kg/m2. Contrary to expectations, results from NHIS indicated that individuals in the first decile of relative BMI had the highest MR whereas relative BMI was not associated with MR in the NHANES and HRS. We hypothesized that the stigmatization of obesity might lead to an increased MR after controlling for absolute BMI. Contrary to expectations, a higher relative BMI was not associated with an increased MR independent of absolute BMI. This study assessed the factor structure of a novel self-report measure of weight- and shape-based social identity threat vulnerability, Social Identities and Attitudes Scale-Weight and Body Shape (SIAS-WBS). Weight and race diverse young adults (N = 542; Mage=21.69 +2.32; 69\% ciswomen) were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk and a university participant pool. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, measurement invariance, internal consistency, convergent validity, and test-retest reliability were conducted. The SIAS-WBS had acceptable factor structure with 15 subscales that were invariant across race, ethnicity, gender, weight perception, and CDC-defined weight groups. The measure demonstrated high internal consistency, convergent validity, and good test-retest reliability. Subscales were Weight \& Shape Identification (Influence and Centrality), Weight \& Shape Stigma Consciousness, six identification and six negative affect factors across the domains of: Social, Familial, Romantic, Intellectual, Physical Activity, and Physical Attractiveness. Participants in higher weight groups who perceived themselves as lower weight status, reported lower Weight \& Shape Identification-Influence (p = 0.02) and lower Stigma Consciousness (p = 0.01), relative to those perceiving themselves as higher weight status. Participants perceiving themselves as higher weight status endorsed lower Physical Activity Identification (p {$<$} 0.001) and more negative affect across all domains (p's {$<$} 0.02). This suggests that weight misperceivers may be less susceptible to weight-based identity threat. When people are placed in a situation where they are at risk of substantiating a negative stereotype about their social group (a scenario termed stereotype threat), the extra pressure to avoid this outcome can undermine their performance. Substantial and consistent gender disparities in STEM fields leave women vulnerable to stereotype threat, including the stereotype that women are not as good at generating creative and innovative ideas as men. We tested whether female students' creative thinking is affected by a stereotype threat by measuring power in the alpha frequency band (8\textendash 12Hz oscillations) that has been associated with better creative thinking outcomes. Counter to expectations that a stereotype threat would reduce alpha power associated with creative thinking, analyses showed increased alpha power following the introduction of the stereotype threat. This outcome suggests that women may have attempted to increase their internal attention during the task in order to disprove the stereotype. Behaviorally, this effort did not lead to changes in creative performance, suggesting that the stereotype threat decoupled alpha power from creative thinking outcomes. These results support a growing school of thought in the neuroscience of creativity literature that the alpha power often seen in conjunction with creative behavior is not necessarily related to the creativity processes themselves, but rather might be part of a larger network modulating the distribution of attentional resources more broadly.},

  abstract = {Ascidians present a striking dichotomy between conserved phenotypes and divergent genomes: embryonic cell lineages and gene expression patterns are conserved between distantly related species. Much research has focused on Ciona or Halocynthia spp. but development in other ascidians remains poorly characterized. In this study, we surveyed the multipotent myogenic B7.5 lineage in Molgula spp. Comparisons to the homologous lineage in Ciona revealed identical cell division and fate specification events that result in segregation of larval, cardiac, and pharyngeal muscle progenitors. Moreover, the expression patterns of key regulators are conserved, but cross-species transgenic assays uncovered incompatibility, or `unintelligibility', of orthologous cis-regulatory sequences between Molgula and Ciona. These sequences drive identical expression patterns that are not recapitulated in cross-species assays. We show that this unintelligibility is likely due to changes in both cis- and trans-acting elements, hinting at widespread and frequent turnover of regulatory mechanisms underlying otherwise conserved aspects of ascidian embryogenesis., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03728.001, When two species have features that look similar, this may be because the features arise by the same processes during development. Other features may look similar yet develop by different mechanisms. `Developmental system drift' refers to the process where a physical feature remains unaltered during evolution, but the underlying pathway that controls its development is changed. However, to date, there have been only a few experimental studies that support this idea., Ascidians\textemdash also commonly known as sea squirts\textemdash are vase-like marine creatures, which start off as tadpole-like larvae that swim around until they find a place to settle down and attach themselves. Once attached, the sea squirts lose the ability to swim and start feeding, typically by filtering material out of the seawater. Sea squirts and their close relatives are the invertebrates (animals without backbones) that are most closely related to all vertebrates (animals with backbones), including humans. Furthermore, although different species of sea squirt have almost identical embryos, their genomes are very different., Stolfi et al. have now studied whether developmental system drift may have occurred during the evolution of ascidians, by analyzing different species of sea squirt named Molgula and Ciona. Stolfi et al. compared the genomes of Molgula and Ciona and studied the expression of genes in the cells that give rise to the heart and the muscles of the head. As an embryo develops, specific genes are switched on or off, and these patterns of gene activation were broadly identical in the two species of sea squirt examined., Enhancers are sequences of DNA that control when and how a gene is switched on. Given the similarities between the development of heart and head muscle cells in the different sea squirts, Stolfi et al. looked to see if the mechanisms of gene expression, and therefore the enhancers, were also conserved. Unexpectedly, this was not the case. When enhancers from Molgula were introduced into Ciona (and vice versa), these sequences were unable to switch on gene expression\textemdash thus enhancers from one sea squirt species could not function in the other., Stolfi et al. conclude that the developmental systems may have drifted considerably during evolution of the sea squirts, in spite of their nearly identical embryos. This reinforces the view that different paths can lead to the formation of similar physical features., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03728.002},

In addition to its 12 previously identified protein-binding sites, sparkling is densely populated with previously unmapped regulatory sequences, which interact in complex ways to control gene expression. One segment is essential for activation at a distance, yet dispensable for other activation functions and for cell type patterning. Unexpectedly, rearranging sparkling's regulatory sites converts it into a robust photoreceptor-specific enhancer. Our results show that a single combination of regulatory inputs can encode multiple outputs, and suggest that the enhancer's organization determines the correct expression pattern by facilitating certain short-range regulatory interactions at the expense of others.},

  abstract = {Considerable progress towards an understanding of complex diseases has been made in recent years due to the development of high-throughput genotyping technologies. Using microarrays that contain millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Genome Wide Association Studies (GWASs) have identified SNPs that are associated with many complex diseases or traits. For example, as of February 2015, 2111 association studies have identified 15,396 SNPs for various diseases and traits, with the number of identified SNP-disease/trait associations increasing rapidly in recent years. However, it has been difficult for researchers to understand disease risk from GWAS results. This is because most GWAS-identified SNPs are located in non-coding regions of the genome. It is important to consider that the GWAS-identified SNPs serve only as representatives for all SNPs in the same haplotype block, and it is equally likely that other SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the array-identified SNPs are causal for the disease. Because it was hoped that disease-associated coding variants would be identified if the true casual SNPs were known, investigators have expanded their analyses using LD calculation and fine-mapping. However, such analyses also identified risk-associated SNPs located in non-coding regions. Thus, the GWAS field has been left with the conundrum as to how a single-nucleotide change in a non-coding region could confer increased risk for a specific disease. One possible answer to this puzzle is that the variant SNPs cause changes in gene expression levels rather than causing changes in protein function. This review provides a description of (1) advances in genomic and epigenomic approaches that incorporate functional annotation of regulatory elements to prioritize the disease risk-associated SNPs that are located in non-coding regions of the genome for follow-up studies, (2) various computational tools that aid in identifying gene expression changes caused by the non-coding disease-associated SNPs, and (3) experimental approaches to identify target genes of, and study the biological phenotypes conferred by, non-coding disease-associated SNPs.},

  abstract = {The Brachyury genes of two divergent ascidians, As-T of Halocynthia roretzi and Ci-Bra of Ciona intestinalis, are expressed exclusively in notochord precursor cells. A previous study showed that the notochord-specific expression of Ci-Bra is controlled by a minimal promoter that is composed of three distinct regions: a region responsible for repression of expression in non-notochord mesoderm cells, a region for activation of expression in notochord cells, and a region for activation of expression in non-notochord mesoderm cells, distal to proximal to the transcription initiation site, respectively. We examined various deletion constructs of the As-T/lacZ fusion gene and demonstrate that a module between -289 and -250 bp of the 5{${'}$}-flanking region is responsible for notochord-specific expression of the reporter gene. Gel-shift assays suggested the binding of nuclear protein(s) to this module. The 5{${'}$}-flanking region of As-T contains a potential T-binding motif (-ACCTAGGT-) around -160 bp. Deletion of this motif from the p(-289)As-T/lacZ diminished the reporter gene expression. In addition, coinjection of p(-289)As-T/lacZ and synthetic As-T mRNA resulted in ectopic expression of lacZ in non-notochord cells, suggesting that the T-binding motif is responsible for autoactivation of the gene. These findings revealed striking differences between the minimal promoters of As-T and Ci-Bra so far revealed, with respect to their notochord-specific expression. Furthermore, reciprocal injections of reporter gene constructs, namely As-T/lacZ into Ciona eggs and Ci-Bra/lacZ into Halocynthia eggs, suggest alterations in the cis-regulatory elements and trans-activation factors that have occurred during evolution of the two ascidian species.},

Such a focus moves conceptualizations of ST effects in education beyond the influence on a student's performance, skill level, and feelings of self-efficacy per se to experiencing greater belonging uncertainty and lower interest in stereotyped tasks and domains. These negative experiences are associated with important outcomes such as decreased persistence and domain identification, even among students who are high in achievement motivation. In this vein, we present and review support for the Motivational Experience Model of ST, a self-regulatory model framework for integrating research on ST, achievement goals, sense of belonging, and intrinsic motivation to make predictions for how stigmatized students' motivational experiences are maintained or disrupted, particularly over long periods of time.},

Here we show that the recessive short-tailed Ciona savignyi mutation chongmague(chm) has a novel defect in the formation of a morphological boundary around the developing notochord. chm notochord cells initiate intercalation normally, but then fail to maintain their polarized cell morphology and migrate inappropriately to become dispersed in the larval tail. This is unlike aimless (aim), a mutation in the PCP pathway component Prickle, which has a severe defect in early mediolateral intercalation but forms a robust notochord boundary. Positional cloning identifies chm as a mutation in the C. savignyi ortholog of the vertebrate alpha 3/4/5 family of laminins. Cs-lam{$\alpha$}3/4/5 is highly expressed in the developing notochord, and Cs-lam{$\alpha$}3/4/5 protein is specifically localized to the outer border of the notochord. Notochord convergence and extension, reduced but not absent in both chm and aim, are essentially abolished in the aim/aim; chm/chm double mutant, indicating that laminin-mediated boundary formation and PCP-dependent mediolateral intercalation are each able to drive a remarkable degree of tail morphogenesis in the absence of the other. These mechanisms therefore initially act in parallel, but we also find that PCP signaling has an important later role in maintaining the perinotochordal/intranotochordal polarity of Cs-lam{$\alpha$}3/4/5 localization.},

  abstract = {The mammalian radiation has corresponded with rapid changes in noncoding regions of the genome, but we lack a comprehensive understanding of regulatory evolution in mammals. Here, we track the evolution of promoters and enhancers active in liver across 20 mammalian species from six diverse orders by profiling genomic enrichment of H3K27 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation. We report that~rapid evolution of enhancers is a universal feature of mammalian genomes. Most of the recently evolved enhancers arise from ancestral DNA exaptation, rather than lineage-specific expansions of repeat elements. In contrast, almost all liver promoters are partially or fully conserved across these species. Our data further reveal that recently evolved enhancers can be associated with genes under positive selection, demonstrating the power of this approach for annotating regulatory adaptations in genomic sequences.

Evidence is presented that the doublesex-related gene DMRT is expressed throughout the anterior neural plate of neurulating embryos. It leads to the activation of FoxC and ZicL in the palp placode and anterior neural tube, respectively. This differential expression depends on FGF signaling, which inhibits FoxC expression in the anterior neural tube.

We found most respondents were unable to distinguish computer literacy activities from computer science, with female, Black, or Hispanic respondents even less likely to do so. Perceptions of who does computer science were narrow and stereotypical (White, male, smart), but there was high value and demand for computer science across all populations, particularly among parents. Results indicate discrepancies in access to technology and computer science. Over 75\% of principals reported their school did not offer computer science with programming/coding, but Hispanic students reported lower exposure to computers at home and in school and Black students and lower income students reported less access to computer science learning in school. Hispanic students and female students were also less likely to have learned computer science or have confidence to learn computer science compared to their counterparts. Finally, we explored barriers to access and identified a harsh disconnect: parent and student demand for computer science education was high while administrators' perceptions of this demand was low. Additionally, the most common barriers to offering computer science cited by principals and superintendents were the need to dedicate time to other courses and testing requirements and the lack of qualified teachers, with technology less common of a barrier.},

We show that FGF\textendash MAPK signalling maintains multipotency and promotes the pharyngeal muscle fate, whereas signal termination permits the deployment of a pan-cardiac programme, shared by the first and second heart lineages, to define heart identity. In the second heart lineage, a Tbx1/10-Dach pathway actively suppresses the first heart lineage programme, conditioning later cell diversity in the beating heart. Finally, cross-species comparisons between Ciona and the mouse evoke the deep evolutionary origins of cardiopharyngeal networks in chordates.},

Interestingly, these regions showed lower numbers of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, heterozygosity, and derived allele frequencies, suggesting that they are under constraint and may be functional.                        ,              Diversity in human-specific regions of the genome has been reduced by functional constraints.           ,              Although only 5\% of the human genome is conserved across mammals, a substantially larger portion is biochemically active, raising the question of whether the additional elements evolve neutrally or confer a lineage-specific fitness advantage. To address this question, we integrate human variation information from the 1000 Genomes Project and activity data from the ENCODE Project. A broad range of transcribed and regulatory nonconserved elements show decreased human diversity, suggesting lineage-specific purifying selection. Conversely, conserved elements lacking activity show increased human diversity, suggesting that some recently became nonfunctional. Regulatory elements under human constraint in nonconserved regions were found near color vision and nerve-growth genes, consistent with purifying selection for recently evolved functions. Our results suggest continued turnover in regulatory regions, with at least an additional 4\% of the human genome subject to lineage-specific constraint.},

Because of their unique evolutionary position as the sister group of the vertebrates, tunicates are invaluable as a comparative model and hold the promise of revealing both conserved and derived features of chordate gastrulation. Descriptive studies in a broad range of tunicates have revealed several important unifying traits that make them unique among the chordates, including invariant cell lineages through gastrula stages and an overall morphological simplicity. Gastrulation has only been studied in detail in ascidians such as Ciona and Phallusia, where it involves a simple cup-shaped gastrula driven primarily by endoderm invagination. This appears to differ significantly from vertebrate models, such as Xenopus, in which mesoderm convergent extension and epidermal epiboly are major contributors to involution. These differences may reflect the cellular simplicity of the ascidian embryo.},

Most blastomeres in the model chordate                 Ciona robusta                 become restricted to a single predominant fate between the 64-cell and mid-gastrula stages. The deeply stereotyped and well-characterized                 Ciona                 embryonic cell lineages allow the transcriptomic analysis of newly established cell types very early in their divergence from sibling cell states without the pseudotime inference needed in the analysis of less synchronized cell populations. This is the first ascidian study to use droplet scRNAseq with large numbers of analyzed cells as early as the 64-cell stage when major lineages such as primary notochord first become fate restricted.                                                        Results and conclusions                                We identify 59 distinct cell states, including new subregions of the b-line neural lineage and the early induction of the tail tip epidermis. We find that 34 of these cell states are directly or indirectly dependent on MAPK-mediated signaling critical to early                 Ciona                 patterning. Most of the MAPK-dependent bifurcations are canalized with the signal-induced cell fate lost upon MAPK inhibition, but the posterior endoderm is unique in being transformed into a novel state expressing some but not all markers of both endoderm and muscle. Divergent gene expression between newly bifurcated sibling cell types is dominated by upregulation in the induced cell type. The Ets family transcription factor Elk1/3/4 is uniquely upregulated in nearly all the putatively direct inductions. Elk1/3/4 upregulation together with Ets transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis enables inferences about which bifurcations are directly versus indirectly controlled by MAPK signaling. We examine notochord induction in detail and find that the transition between a Zic/Ets-mediated regulatory state and a Brachyury/FoxA-mediated regulatory state is unexpectedly late. This supports a ``broad-hourglass'' model of cell fate specification in which many early tissue-specific genes are induced in parallel to key tissue-specific transcriptional regulators via the same set of transcriptional inputs.},

However, these methods often generate multiplet artifacts, where two or more cells receive the same barcode, resulting in a hybrid transcriptome. In most experiments, multiplets account for several percent of transcriptomes and can confound downstream data analysis. Here, we present Single-Cell Remover of Doublets (Scrublet), a framework for predicting the impact of multiplets in a given analysis and identifying problematic multiplets. Scrublet avoids the need for expert knowledge or cell clustering by simulating multiplets from the data and building a nearest neighbor classifier.

  abstract = {Enhancer function, from sponges to humans Identifying the function of enhancers, DNA regions that help to regulate gene expression and evolve rapidly, has been difficult. This area of research has been hampered by the difficultly in identifying functional conservation. Wong et al. now show that despite low sequence conservation, enhancer function is strongly conserved through the animal kingdom (see the Perspective by Harmston). Transgenic expression of sponge enhancers in zebrafish and mice demonstrates that these sequences can drive cell type\textendash specific gene expression across species. These results suggest an unexpectedly deep level of conservation of gene regulation across the animal kingdom maintained over the course of metazoan evolution. Science, this issue p. eaax8137; see also p. 657 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONIn animals, gene regulatory networks specify cell identity in space and time. Transcription of genes in these networks is modulated by a class of cis-regulatory elements called enhancers that contain short (\textasciitilde 10 base pairs) DNA sequence motifs recognized by transcription factors (TFs). In contrast to TFs, whose histories have been largely traced to the origin of the animal kingdom or earlier, the origin and evolution of enhancers have been relatively difficult to discern.Although not a single enhancer has been shown to be conserved across the animal kingdom, enhancers may be as ancient and conserved as the TFs with which they interact. This inability to identify conserved enhancers is apparently because they evolve faster than both the TFs they interact with and the genes they regulate. RATIONALEPutative enhancers in the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica had previously been identified on the basis of combinatorial patterns of histone modifications. Here, we sought to determine whether sponges share functionally conserved enhancers with bilaterians.We primarily focused on deeply conserved metazoan microsyntenic gene pairs. These pairs are thought to be conserved because the cis-regulatory elements that regulate the developmental expression of one gene (the target gene) are located in the other gene (the bystander gene). This proposed regulatory linkage may underlie the maintenance of these microsyntenic gene pairs across 700 million years of independent evolution. RESULTSWe found that enhancers present in Amphimedon microsyntenic regions drive consistent patterns of cell type\textendash specific gene expression in zebrafish and mouse embryos. Although these sponge enhancers do not share significant sequence identity with vertebrates, they are in microsyntenic regions that are orthologous with microsyntenic regions in other metazoans and have strong histone H3 Lys4 methylation (H3K4me1) enhancer signals.Focusing on an Islet enhancer in the Islet-Scaper microsyntenic region, we found that the sponge 709\textendash base pair enhancer, independent of its orientation, drives green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in zebrafish cells in the hindbrain neuroepithelial region, the roof plate around the midline, the pectoral fin, and the otic vesicle; the activity overlaps with endogenous Isl2a expression. Systematic removal of sequences from the Amphimedon Islet enhancer revealed that both the 5{${'}$} and 3{${'}$} regions of this enhancer are required for consistent cell type\textendash specific activity in zebrafish.We then used the number and frequency of TF binding motifs in the Amphimedon Islet enhancer to identify putative enhancers in human, mouse, and fly Islet-Scaper regions. The candidate orthologous enhancers from humans and mice drove gene expression patterns similar to those in sponges and endogenous Islet enhancers in zebrafish.We also demonstrated that a number of putative Amphimedon enhancers, which are outside conserved microsyntenic regions, can also drive unique expression patterns: Enhancers of sponge housekeeping genes drive broader expression patterns in zebrafish. CONCLUSIONThese results suggest the existence of an ancient and conserved, yet flexible, genomic regulatory syntax that (i) can be interpreted by the available TFs present in cells constituting disparate developmental systems and cell types, and (ii) has been repeatedly co-opted into cell type\textendash specific networks across the animal kingdom.This common regulatory code maintains a repertoire of conserved TF binding motifs that stabilize and preserve enhancer functionality over evolution. Once established, these enhancers may be maintained as part of conserved gene regulatory network modules over evolution. Although robust, these enhancers can evolve through the expansion and integration of new TF binding motifs and the loss of others. We posit that the expansion of TFs and enhancers may underlie the evolution of complex body plans. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/370/6517/eaax8137/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Islet enhancer activity is conserved across animal evolution.Enhancers located within conserved microsyntenic units in the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica are tested in a zebrafish transgenic reporter system. In zebrafish, the sponge Islet enhancer drives a GFP reporter expression pattern similar to that of human, mouse, and zebrafish enhancers identified within the Islet-Scaper microsyntenic region. This suggests the conservation of regulatory syntax specified by flexible organizations of motifs. Interactions of transcription factors (TFs) with DNA regulatory sequences, known as enhancers, specify cell identity during animal development. Unlike TFs, the origin and evolution of enhancers has been difficult to trace. We drove zebrafish and mouse developmental transcription using enhancers from an evolutionarily distant marine sponge. Some of these sponge enhancers are located in highly conserved microsyntenic regions, including an Islet enhancer in the Islet-Scaper region. We found that Islet enhancers in humans and mice share a suite of TF binding motifs with sponges, and that they drive gene expression patterns similar to those of sponge and endogenous Islet enhancers in zebrafish. Our results suggest the existence of an ancient and conserved, yet flexible, genomic regulatory syntax that has been repeatedly co-opted into cell type\textendash specific gene regulatory networks across the animal kingdom. Across the animal kingdom, enhancer function is conserved throughout 700 million years of evolution.

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section In ascidian embryos, Brachyury is expressed exclusively in blastomeres of the notochord lineage and play an essential role in the notochord cell differentiation. The genetic cascade leading to the transcriptional activation of Brachyury in A-line notochord cells of Ciona embryos begins with maternally provided {$\beta$}-catenin, which is essential for endodermal cell specification. {$\beta$}-catenin directly activates zygotic expression of a forkhead transcription factor gene, FoxD, at the 16-cell stage, which in turn somehow activates a zinc finger transcription factor gene, ZicL, at the 32-cell stage, and then Brachyury at the 64-cell stage. One of the key questions to be answered is whether ZicL functions as a direct activator of Brachyury transcription, and this was addressed in the present study. A fusion protein was constructed in which a zinc finger domain of Ciona ZicL was connected to the C-terminus of GST. Extensive series of PCR-assisted binding site selection assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the most plausible recognition sequence of Ciona ZicL was CCCGCTGTG. We found the elements CACAGCTGG (complementary sequence: CCAGCTGTG) at -123 and CCAGCTGTG at -168 bp upstream of the putative transcription start site of Ci-Bra in a previously identified basal enhancer of this gene. In vitro binding assays indicated that the ZicL fusion protein binds to these elements efficiently. A fusion gene construct in which lacZ was fused with the upstream sequence of Ci-Bra showed the reporter gene expression exclusively in notochord cells when the construct was introduced into fertilized eggs. In contrast, fusion constructs with mutated ZicL-binding-elements failed to show the reporter expression. In addition, suppression of Ci-ZicL abolished the reporter gene expression, while ectopic and/or overexpression of Ci-ZicL resulted in ectopic reporter expression in non-notochord cells. These results provide evidence that ZicL directly activates Brachyury, leading to specification and subsequent differentiation of notochord cells.},

Surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy is the first-choice treatment modality in these patients, since chordomas are resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Even so, management of chordomas can be challenging, as chordoma patients often present with recurrent disease.
