  abstract = {The gene regulatory apparatus that directs development is encoded in the DNA, in the form of organized arrays of transcription factor target sites. Genes are regulated by interactions with multiple transcription factors and the target sites for the transcription factors required for the control of each gene constitute its cis-regulatory system. These systems are remarkably complex. Their hardwired internal organization enables them to behave as genomic information processing systems. Developmental gene regulatory networks consist of the cis-regulatory systems of all the relevant genes and the regulatory linkages amongst them. Though there is yet little explicit information, some general properties of genomic regulatory networks have become apparent. The key to understanding how genomic regulatory networks are organized, and how they work, lies in experimental analysis of cis-regulatory systems at all levels of the regulatory network.},

  abstract = {The notochord is a structure common to all chordates, and the feature that the phylum Chordata has been named after. It is a rod-like mesodermal structure that runs the anterior–posterior length of the embryo, adjacent to the ventral neural tube. The notochord plays a critical role in embryonic tissue patterning, for example the dorsal–ventral patterning of the neural tube. The cells that will come to form the notochord are specified at gastrulation. Axial mesodermal cells arising at the anterior primitive streak migrate anteriorly as the precursors of the notochord and populate the notochordal plate. Yet, even though a lot of interest has centered on investigating the functional and structural roles of the notochord, we still have a very rudimentary understanding of notochord morphogenesis. The events driving the formation of the notochord are rapid, taking place over the period of approximately a day in mice. In this commentary, we provide an overview of our current understanding of mouse notochord morphogenesis, from the initial specification of axial mesendodermal cells at the primitive streak, the emergence of these cells at the midline on the surface of the embryo, to their submergence and organization of the stereotypically positioned notochord. We will also discuss some key open questions. Developmental Dynamics 245:547–557, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Divergence in gene expression due to cis-regulatory variants in noncoding regions is central to disease susceptibility. We show that integrative computational analysis of phylogenetic conservation with a complexity assessment of co-occurring transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) can identify cis-regulatory variants and elucidate their mechanistic role in disease. Analysis of established type 2 diabetes risk loci revealed a striking clustering of distinct homeo-box TFBS. We identified the PRRX1 homeobox factor as a repressor of PPARG2 expression in adipose cells and demonstrate its adverse effect on lipid metabolism and systemic insulin sensitivity, dependent on the rs4684847 risk allele that triggers PRRX1 binding. Thus, cross-species conservation analysis at the level of co-occurring TFBS provides a valuable contribution to the translation of genetic association signals to disease-related molecular mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The notochord is an embryonic midline structure common to all members of the phylum Chordata, providing both mechanical and signaling cues to the developing embryo. In vertebrates, the notochord arises from the dorsal organizer and it is critical for proper vertebrate development. This evolutionary conserved structure located at the developing midline defines the primitive axis of embryos and represents the structural element essential for locomotion. Besides its primary structural function, the notochord is also a source of developmental signals that patterns surrounding tissues. Among the signals secreted by the notochord, Hedgehog proteins play key roles during embryogenesis. The Hedgehog signaling pathway is a central regulator of embryonic development, controlling the patterning and proliferation of a wide variety of organs. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on notochord structure and functions, with a particular emphasis on the key developmental events that take place in vertebrates. Moreover, we discuss some genetic studies highlighting the phenotypic consequences of impaired notochord development, which enabled to understand the molecular basis of different human congenital defects and diseases.},

Ciona has a small genome, and simple, well-defined embyronic lineages. Here, we examine the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differentiation of the notochord. Particular efforts center on the regulation of a notochord-specific Ciona Brachyury gene (Ci-Bra). An electroporation method was devised for the efficient incorporation of transgenic DNA into Ciona embryos. This method permitted the identification of a minimal, 434 bp enhancer from the Ci-Bra promoter region that mediates the notochord-restricted expression of both GFP and lacZ reporter genes. This enhancer contains a negative control region that excludes Ci-Bra expression from inappropriate embryonic lineages, including the trunk mesenchyme and tail muscles. Evidence is presented that the enhancer is activated by a regulatory element which is closely related to the recognition sequence of the Suppressor of Hairless transcription factor, thereby raising the possibility that the Notch signaling pathway plays a role in notochord differentiation. We discuss the implications of this analysis with regard to the evolutionary conservation of integrative enhancers, and the subdivision of the axial and paraxial mesoderm in vertebrates.},

  abstract = {The notochord is a major regulator of embryonic patterning in vertebrates and abnormal notochordal development is associated with a variety of birth defects in man. Proper knowledge of the development of the human notochord, therefore, is important to understand the pathogenesis of these birth defects. Textbook descriptions vary significantly and seem to be derived from both human and animal data whereas the lack of references hampers verification of the presented data. Therefore, a verifiable and comprehensive description of the development of the human notochord is needed. Our analysis and three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of 27 sectioned human embryos ranging from Carnegie Stage 8 to 15 (17–41 days of development), resulted in a comprehensive and verifiable new model of notochordal development. Subsequent to gastrulation, a transient group of cells briefly persists as the notochordal process which is incorporated into the endodermal roof of the gut while its dorsal side attaches to the developing neural tube. Then, the notochordal process embeds entirely into the endoderm, forming the epithelial notochordal plate, which remains intimately associated with the neural tube. Subsequently, the notochordal cells detach from the endoderm to form the definitive notochord, allowing the paired dorsal aortae to fuse between the notochord and the gut. We show that the formation of the notochordal process and plate proceeds in cranio-caudal direction. Moreover, in contrast to descriptions in the modern textbooks, we report that the formation of the definitive notochord in humans starts in the middle of the embryo, and proceeds in both cranial and caudal directions.},

The Ciona genome contains approximately 16,000 protein-coding genes, similar to the number in other invertebrates, but only half that found in vertebrates. Vertebrate gene families are typically found in simplified form in Ciona, suggesting that ascidians contain the basic ancestral complement of genes involved in cell signaling and development.

  abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers are short segments of DNA that switch genes on and off in response to a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Despite the discovery of the first enhancer more than 30 y ago, the relationship between primary DNA sequence and enhancer activity remains obscure. In particular, the importance of “syntax” (the order, orientation, and spacing of binding sites) is unclear. A high-throughput screen identified synthetic notochord enhancers that are activated by the combination of ZicL and ETS transcription factors in Ciona embryos. Manipulation of these enhancers elucidated a “regulatory code” of sequence and syntax features for notochord-specific expression. This code enabled in silico discovery of bona fide notochord enhancers, including those containing low-affinity binding sites that would be excluded by standard motif identification methods. One of the newly identified enhancers maps upstream of the known enhancer that regulates Brachyury (Ci-Bra), a key determinant of notochord specification. This newly identified Ci-Bra shadow enhancer contains binding sites with very low affinity, but optimal syntax, and therefore mediates surprisingly strong expression in the notochord. Weak binding sites are compensated by optimal syntax, whereas enhancers containing high-affinity binding affinities possess suboptimal syntax. We suggest this balance has obscured the importance of regulatory syntax, as noncanonical binding motifs are typically disregarded by enhancer detection methods. As a result, enhancers with low binding affinities but optimal syntax may be a vastly underappreciated feature of the regulatory genome.},

  abstract = {It has long been the dream of biologists to map gene expression at the single-cell level. With such data one might track heterogeneous cell sub-populations, and infer regulatory relationships between genes and pathways. Recently, RNA sequencing has achieved single-cell resolution. What is limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual cells for quantitative in-depth sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. The reproducibility of these high-throughput single-cell data allowed us~to deconstruct cell populations and infer gene expression relationships. Video Abstract},

Recent studies have shown that shadow enhancers are remarkably abundant and control most developmental gene expression in both invertebrates and vertebrates, including mammals. Shadow enhancers might provide an important mechanism for buffering gene expression against mutations in non-coding regulatory regions of genes implicated in human disease. Technological advances in genome editing and live imaging have shed light on how shadow enhancers establish precise gene expression patterns and confer phenotypic robustness. Shadow enhancers can interact in complex ways and may also help to drive the formation of transcriptional hubs within the nucleus. Despite their apparent redundancy, the prevalence and evolutionary conservation of shadow enhancers underscore their key role in emerging metazoan gene regulatory networks.},

Age-related changes in the intervertebral discs are thought to cause most cases of back pain. Back pain affects more than half of people over the age of 65, and the treatment of back pain costs 50–100 billion dollars per year in the USA. The normal intervertebral disc is composed of three distinct regions: a thick outer ring of fibrous cartilage called the annulus fibrosus, a gel-like material that is surrounded by the annulus fibrosus called the nucleus pulposus, and superior and inferior cartilaginous end plates. The nucleus pulposus has been shown to be critical for disc health and function. Damage to this structure often leads to disc disease. Recent reports have demonstrated that the embryonic notochord, a rod-like structure present in the midline of vertebrate embryos, gives rise to all cell types found in adult nuclei pulposi. The mechanism responsible for the transformation of the notochord into nuclei pulposi is unknown. In this review, we discuss potential molecular and physical mechanisms that may be responsible for the notochord to nuclei pulposi transition.},

Critical enhancers are sometimes even found within the introns of neighboring genes. This review summarizes well-defined examples of enhancers controlling key processes in animal development. Potential mechanisms of transcriptional synergy are discussed with regard to enhancer structure and contemporary ChIP-sequencing assays, whereby just a small fraction of the observed binding sites represent bona fide regulatory DNAs.

Since acquisition of a tadpole-like tail during tailbud stage is one of the key events in the evolution of chordates, understanding the anatomy of the tailbud stage chordate embryo is of special interest. In this study, to understand comprehensively the anatomy of the tailbud embryo at single-cell-level, real microscopic image stacks of the tailbud embryo in Ciona intestinalis were reconstructed into a 3D computer model. This comprehensive 3D model of the ascidian tailbud embryo was based on real images of confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and therefore, cell shape, location and cell arrangement reflect real geometries of the tailbud embryo. We found that the tailbud embryo consists of 1579 cells, including 836 epidermal cells, 228 cells in the central nervous system, 218 mesenchymal cells, four trunk ventral cells, two B/B⁎8.11 cells, 36 muscle cells, 40 notochord cells, four primordial germ cells, and 199 endodermal cells. Moreover, we identified for the first time two populations of previously undefined cells (a total of 12 cells) in Ciona: one located in the lateral trunk and the other located under the tail dorsal epidermis. This information provides a first step for understanding how the body plan of the chordate tailbud embryo formed and evolved.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, high-throughput sequencing methods have revolutionized the entire field of biology. The opportunity to study entire transcriptomes in great detail using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has fueled many important discoveries and is now a routine method in biomedical research. However, RNA-seq is typically performed in “bulk,” and the data represent an average of gene expression patterns across thousands to millions of cells; this might obscure biologically relevant differences between cells. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) represents an approach to overcome this problem. By isolating single cells, capturing their transcripts, and generating sequencing libraries in which the transcripts are mapped to individual cells, scRNA-seq allows assessment of fundamental biological properties of cell populations and biological systems at unprecedented resolution. Here, we present the most common scRNA-seq protocols in use today and the basics of data analysis and discuss factors that are important to consider before planning and designing an scRNA-seq project. © 2018 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Here, we perform RNAseq on flow-sorted notochord cells from multiple stages to define a comprehensive Ciona notochord transcriptome. We identify 1364 genes with enriched expression and extensively validate the results by in situ hybridization. These genes are highly enriched for Gene Ontology terms related to the extracellular matrix, cell adhesion and cytoskeleton. Orthologs of 112 of the Ciona notochord genes have known notochord expression in vertebrates, more than twice as many as predicted by chance alone. This set of putative effector genes with notochord expression conserved from tunicates to vertebrates will be invaluable for testing hypotheses about notochord evolution. The full set of Ciona notochord genes provides a foundation for systems-level studies of notochord gene regulation and morphogenesis. We find only modest overlap between this set of notochord-enriched transcripts and the genes upregulated by ectopic expression of the key notochord transcription factor Brachyury, indicating that Brachyury is not a notochord master regulator gene as strictly defined.},

Taking advantage of the availability of various genetically encoded fluorescent proteins and of defined cis-regulatory elements, we combined transient transgenesis with laser scanning confocal imaging to acquire and quantitate 3D time-lapse data from living Ciona embryos. We used Ciona tissue-specific enhancers to drive expression of spectrally distinct fluorescent protein reporters to label and simultaneously visualize axially and paraxially positioned mesodermal derivatives, as well as neural precursors in individual embryos. We observed morphogenetic movements, without perturbing development, from the early gastrula throughout the larval stage, including gastrulation, neurulation, convergent extension of the presumptive notochord, and tail elongation. These multidimensional data allowed us to establish a reference system of metrics to quantify key developmental events including blastopore closure and muscle extension. The approach we describe can be used to document morphogenetic cell and tissue rearrangements in living embryos and paves the way for a live digitized anatomical atlas of Ciona. genesis 43:136–147, 2005.},

  abstract = {The notochord is a key structure during chordate development. We have previously identified several enhancers regulated by Zic and ETS that encode notochord activity within the marine chordate Ciona robusta (Ciona). To better understand the role of Zic and ETS within notochord enhancers, we tested 90 genomic elements containing Zic and ETS sites for expression in developing Ciona embryos using a whole-embryo, massively parallel reporter assay. We discovered that 39/90 of the elements were active in developing embryos; however only 10\% were active within the notochord, indicating that more than just Zic and ETS sites are required for notochord expression. Further analysis revealed notochord enhancers were regulated by three groups of factors: (1) Zic and ETS, (2) Zic, ETS and Brachyury (Bra), and (3) Zic, ETS, Bra and FoxA. One of these notochord enhancers, regulated by Zic and ETS, is located upstream of laminin alpha, a gene critical for notochord development in both Ciona and vertebrates. Reversing the ETS sites in this enhancer greatly diminish expression, indicating that enhancer grammar is critical for enhancer activity. Strikingly, we find clusters of Zic and ETS binding sites within the introns of mouse and human laminin alpha 1 with conserved enhancer grammar. Our analysis also identified two notochord enhancers regulated by Zic, ETS, FoxA and Bra binding sites: the Bra Shadow (BraS) enhancer located in close proximity to Bra, and an enhancer located near the gene Lrig. Randomizing the BraS enhancer demonstrates that although the Zic and ETS sites are necessary for enhancer activity, they are not sufficient. We find that FoxA and Bra sites contribute to BraS enhancer activity. Zic, ETS, FoxA and Bra binding sites occur within the Ciona Bra434 enhancer and vertebrate notochord Brachyury enhancers, suggesting a conserved regulatory logic. Collectively, this study deepens our understanding of how enhancers encode notochord expression, illustrates the importance of enhancer grammar, and hints at the conservation of enhancer logic and grammar across chordates.},

In this review, I discuss the embryonic origin, signalling roles and ultimate fate of the notochord, with an emphasis on structural aspects of notochord biology.},

We discuss aspects of new technologies that will need to be developed to rise up and meet the computational challenges that genomics poses for the near future.

To address this question, we integrate human variation information from the 1000 Genomes Project and activity data from the ENCODE Project. A broad range of transcribed and regulatory nonconserved elements show decreased human diversity, suggesting lineage-specific purifying selection. Conversely, conserved elements lacking activity show increased human diversity, suggesting that some recently became nonfunctional. Regulatory elements under human constraint in nonconserved regions were found near color vision and nerve-growth genes, consistent with purifying selection for recently evolved functions. Our results suggest continued turnover in regulatory regions, with at least an additional 4\% of the human genome subject to lineage-specific constraint.},

Because of their unique evolutionary position as the sister group of the vertebrates, tunicates are invaluable as a comparative model and hold the promise of revealing both conserved and derived features of chordate gastrulation. Descriptive studies in a broad range of tunicates have revealed several important unifying traits that make them unique among the chordates, including invariant cell lineages through gastrula stages and an overall morphological simplicity. Gastrulation has only been studied in detail in ascidians such as Ciona and Phallusia, where it involves a simple cup-shaped gastrula driven primarily by endoderm invagination. This appears to differ significantly from vertebrate models, such as Xenopus, in which mesoderm convergent extension and epidermal epiboly are major contributors to involution. These differences may reflect the cellular simplicity of the ascidian embryo.},

  abstract = {Enhancer function, from sponges to humans Identifying the function of enhancers, DNA regions that help to regulate gene expression and evolve rapidly, has been difficult. This area of research has been hampered by the difficultly in identifying functional conservation. Wong et al. now show that despite low sequence conservation, enhancer function is strongly conserved through the animal kingdom (see the Perspective by Harmston). Transgenic expression of sponge enhancers in zebrafish and mice demonstrates that these sequences can drive cell type–specific gene expression across species. These results suggest an unexpectedly deep level of conservation of gene regulation across the animal kingdom maintained over the course of metazoan evolution. Science, this issue p. eaax8137; see also p. 657 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONIn animals, gene regulatory networks specify cell identity in space and time. Transcription of genes in these networks is modulated by a class of cis-regulatory elements called enhancers that contain short (\textasciitilde 10 base pairs) DNA sequence motifs recognized by transcription factors (TFs). In contrast to TFs, whose histories have been largely traced to the origin of the animal kingdom or earlier, the origin and evolution of enhancers have been relatively difficult to discern.Although not a single enhancer has been shown to be conserved across the animal kingdom, enhancers may be as ancient and conserved as the TFs with which they interact. This inability to identify conserved enhancers is apparently because they evolve faster than both the TFs they interact with and the genes they regulate. RATIONALEPutative enhancers in the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica had previously been identified on the basis of combinatorial patterns of histone modifications. Here, we sought to determine whether sponges share functionally conserved enhancers with bilaterians.We primarily focused on deeply conserved metazoan microsyntenic gene pairs. These pairs are thought to be conserved because the cis-regulatory elements that regulate the developmental expression of one gene (the target gene) are located in the other gene (the bystander gene). This proposed regulatory linkage may underlie the maintenance of these microsyntenic gene pairs across 700 million years of independent evolution. RESULTSWe found that enhancers present in Amphimedon microsyntenic regions drive consistent patterns of cell type–specific gene expression in zebrafish and mouse embryos. Although these sponge enhancers do not share significant sequence identity with vertebrates, they are in microsyntenic regions that are orthologous with microsyntenic regions in other metazoans and have strong histone H3 Lys4 methylation (H3K4me1) enhancer signals.Focusing on an Islet enhancer in the Islet-Scaper microsyntenic region, we found that the sponge 709–base pair enhancer, independent of its orientation, drives green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in zebrafish cells in the hindbrain neuroepithelial region, the roof plate around the midline, the pectoral fin, and the otic vesicle; the activity overlaps with endogenous Isl2a expression. Systematic removal of sequences from the Amphimedon Islet enhancer revealed that both the 5′ and 3′ regions of this enhancer are required for consistent cell type–specific activity in zebrafish.We then used the number and frequency of TF binding motifs in the Amphimedon Islet enhancer to identify putative enhancers in human, mouse, and fly Islet-Scaper regions. The candidate orthologous enhancers from humans and mice drove gene expression patterns similar to those in sponges and endogenous Islet enhancers in zebrafish.We also demonstrated that a number of putative Amphimedon enhancers, which are outside conserved microsyntenic regions, can also drive unique expression patterns: Enhancers of sponge housekeeping genes drive broader expression patterns in zebrafish. CONCLUSIONThese results suggest the existence of an ancient and conserved, yet flexible, genomic regulatory syntax that (i) can be interpreted by the available TFs present in cells constituting disparate developmental systems and cell types, and (ii) has been repeatedly co-opted into cell type–specific networks across the animal kingdom.This common regulatory code maintains a repertoire of conserved TF binding motifs that stabilize and preserve enhancer functionality over evolution. Once established, these enhancers may be maintained as part of conserved gene regulatory network modules over evolution. Although robust, these enhancers can evolve through the expansion and integration of new TF binding motifs and the loss of others. We posit that the expansion of TFs and enhancers may underlie the evolution of complex body plans. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/370/6517/eaax8137/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Islet enhancer activity is conserved across animal evolution.Enhancers located within conserved microsyntenic units in the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica are tested in a zebrafish transgenic reporter system. In zebrafish, the sponge Islet enhancer drives a GFP reporter expression pattern similar to that of human, mouse, and zebrafish enhancers identified within the Islet-Scaper microsyntenic region. This suggests the conservation of regulatory syntax specified by flexible organizations of motifs. Interactions of transcription factors (TFs) with DNA regulatory sequences, known as enhancers, specify cell identity during animal development. Unlike TFs, the origin and evolution of enhancers has been difficult to trace. We drove zebrafish and mouse developmental transcription using enhancers from an evolutionarily distant marine sponge. Some of these sponge enhancers are located in highly conserved microsyntenic regions, including an Islet enhancer in the Islet-Scaper region. We found that Islet enhancers in humans and mice share a suite of TF binding motifs with sponges, and that they drive gene expression patterns similar to those of sponge and endogenous Islet enhancers in zebrafish. Our results suggest the existence of an ancient and conserved, yet flexible, genomic regulatory syntax that has been repeatedly co-opted into cell type–specific gene regulatory networks across the animal kingdom. Across the animal kingdom, enhancer function is conserved throughout 700 million years of evolution.

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section In ascidian embryos, Brachyury is expressed exclusively in blastomeres of the notochord lineage and play an essential role in the notochord cell differentiation. The genetic cascade leading to the transcriptional activation of Brachyury in A-line notochord cells of Ciona embryos begins with maternally provided β-catenin, which is essential for endodermal cell specification. β-catenin directly activates zygotic expression of a forkhead transcription factor gene, FoxD, at the 16-cell stage, which in turn somehow activates a zinc finger transcription factor gene, ZicL, at the 32-cell stage, and then Brachyury at the 64-cell stage. One of the key questions to be answered is whether ZicL functions as a direct activator of Brachyury transcription, and this was addressed in the present study. A fusion protein was constructed in which a zinc finger domain of Ciona ZicL was connected to the C-terminus of GST. Extensive series of PCR-assisted binding site selection assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the most plausible recognition sequence of Ciona ZicL was CCCGCTGTG. We found the elements CACAGCTGG (complementary sequence: CCAGCTGTG) at -123 and CCAGCTGTG at -168 bp upstream of the putative transcription start site of Ci-Bra in a previously identified basal enhancer of this gene. In vitro binding assays indicated that the ZicL fusion protein binds to these elements efficiently. A fusion gene construct in which lacZ was fused with the upstream sequence of Ci-Bra showed the reporter gene expression exclusively in notochord cells when the construct was introduced into fertilized eggs. In contrast, fusion constructs with mutated ZicL-binding-elements failed to show the reporter expression. In addition, suppression of Ci-ZicL abolished the reporter gene expression, while ectopic and/or overexpression of Ci-ZicL resulted in ectopic reporter expression in non-notochord cells. These results provide evidence that ZicL directly activates Brachyury, leading to specification and subsequent differentiation of notochord cells.},
