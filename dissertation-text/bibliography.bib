	abstract = {Current knowledge about the role of epigenetics in type 2
               diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have
               investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a
               very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic
               islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes.
               Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation
               landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially
               methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate
               the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed
               whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and
               unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at
               a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors
               with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified
               25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover
               loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5
               Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for
               islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and
               different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs.
               We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1,
               SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression
               changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets,
               candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured
               beta-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby
               connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We
               further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link
               between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA
               methylation in different genomic regions and of different
               transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and
               pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our
               study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome
               in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the
               importance of epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic islets and
               T2D pathogenesis.},

@article{Han2022-pi,
	abstract = {A critical problem in the field of post hoc explainability is
                   the lack of a common foundational goal among methods. For
                   example, some methods are motivated by function
                   approximation, some by game theoretic notions, and some by
                   obtaining clean visualizations. This fragmentation of goals
                   causes not only an inconsistent conceptual understanding of
                   explanations but also the practical challenge of not knowing
                   which method to use when. In this work, we begin to address
                   these challenges by unifying eight popular post hoc
                   explanation methods (LIME, C-LIME, KernelSHAP, Occlusion,
                   Vanilla Gradients, Gradients x Input, SmoothGrad, and
                   Integrated Gradients). We show that these methods all perform
                   local function approximation of the black-box model,
                   differing only in the neighbourhood and loss function used to
                   perform the approximation. This unification enables us to (1)
                   state a no free lunch theorem for explanation methods,
                   demonstrating that no method can perform optimally across all
                   neighbourhoods, and (2) provide a guiding principle to choose
                   among methods based on faithfulness to the black-box model.
                   We empirically validate these theoretical results using
                   various real-world datasets, model classes, and prediction
                   tasks. By bringing diverse explanation methods into a common
                   framework, this work (1) advances the conceptual
                   understanding of these methods, revealing their shared local
                   function approximation objective, properties, and relation to
                   one another, and (2) guides the use of these methods in
                   practice, providing a principled approach to choose among
                   methods and paving the way for the creation of new ones.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomly shuffled sequences are routinely used in
              sequence analysis to evaluate the statistical significance of a
              biological sequence. In many cases, biologists need sophisticated
              shuffling tools that preserve not only the counts of distinct
              letters but also higher-order statistics such as doublet counts,
              triplet counts, and, in general, k-let counts. RESULTS: We present
              a sequence analysis tool (named uShuffle) for generating uniform
              random permutations of biological sequences (such as DNAs, RNAs,
              and proteins) that preserve the exact k-let counts. The uShuffle
              tool implements the latest variant of the Euler algorithm and uses
              Wilson's algorithm in the crucial step of arborescence generation.
              It is carefully engineered and extremely efficient. The uShuffle
              tool achieves maximum flexibility by allowing arbitrary alphabet
              size and let size. It can be used as a command-line program, a web
              application, or a utility library. Source code in C, Java, and
              C\#, and integration instructions for Perl and Python are
              provided. CONCLUSION: The uShuffle tool surpasses existing
              implementation of the Euler algorithm in both performance and
              flexibility. It is a useful tool for the bioinformatics community.},

               and environmental risk factors contribute to islet dysfunction

               single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), most of which are
               noncoding, in >200 loci to islet dysfunction and T2D.
               Identification of the putative causal variants and their target

               mediating beta cell survival in response to proinflammatory
               cytokines. We mapped 38,931 cytokine-responsive candidate
               cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in beta cells using ATAC-seq and
               snATAC-seq and linked them to target genes using co-accessibility
               and HiChIP. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen in EndoC-betaH1 cells,
               we identified 867 genes affecting cytokine-induced survival, and
               genes promoting survival and up-regulated in cytokines were
               enriched at T1D risk loci. Using SNP-SELEX, we identified 2,229

               lamprey and hagfish) constitute the three extant groups of
               chordate animals. Traditionally, cephalochordates are considered
               as the closest living relatives of vertebrates, with tunicates
               representing the earliest chordate lineage. This view is mainly
               justified by overall morphological similarities and an apparently
               increased complexity in cephalochordates and vertebrates relative
               to tunicates. Despite their critical importance for understanding
               the origins of vertebrates, phylogenetic studies of chordate
               relationships have provided equivocal results. Taking advantage
               of the genome sequencing of the appendicularian Oikopleura
               dioica, we assembled a phylogenomic data set of 146 nuclear genes
               (33,800 unambiguously aligned amino acids) from 14 deuterostomes

               that phylogenetic analyses of this data set provide compelling
               evidence that tunicates, and not cephalochordates, represent the
               closest living relatives of vertebrates. Chordate monophyly

               its biological function, yet our understanding of higher order
               genomic structure is coarse, fragmented and incomplete. In the
               nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy
               distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been
               proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories.
               These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details
               about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure
               and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies
               have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional
               genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as
               a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions
               genome wide. Here we investigate the three-dimensional
               organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem
               cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented
               resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin
               interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a
               pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These
               domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the
               spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across
               different cell types and highly conserved across species,
               indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of
               mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of
               topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding
               protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short
               interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that
               these factors may have a role in establishing the topological
               domain structure of the genome.},

              Focusing on binding sites for 38 TFs and their pairwise

              more than 30 y ago, the relationship between primary DNA sequence
              and enhancer activity remains obscure. In particular, the
              importance of ``syntax'' (the order, orientation, and spacing of
              binding sites) is unclear. A high-throughput screen identified
              synthetic notochord enhancers that are activated by the
              combination of ZicL and ETS transcription factors in Ciona
              embryos. Manipulation of these enhancers elucidated a ``regulatory
              code'' of sequence and syntax features for notochord-specific
              expression. This code enabled in silico discovery of bona fide
              notochord enhancers, including those containing low-affinity
              binding sites that would be excluded by standard motif
              identification methods. One of the newly identified enhancers maps
              upstream of the known enhancer that regulates Brachyury (Ci-Bra),
              a key determinant of notochord specification. This newly
              identified Ci-Bra shadow enhancer contains binding sites with very
              low affinity, but optimal syntax, and therefore mediates
              surprisingly strong expression in the notochord. Weak binding
              sites are compensated by optimal syntax, whereas enhancers
              containing high-affinity binding affinities possess suboptimal
              syntax. We suggest this balance has obscured the importance of
              regulatory syntax, as noncanonical binding motifs are typically
              disregarded by enhancer detection methods. As a result, enhancers
              with low binding affinities but optimal syntax may be a vastly

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequence analyses
               assume that all acquired RNAs are endogenous to cells. However,
               any cell-free RNAs contained within the input solution are also
               captured by these assays. This sequencing of cell-free RNA
               constitutes a background contamination that confounds the
               biological interpretation of single-cell transcriptomic data.
               RESULTS: We demonstrate that contamination from this ``soup'' of
               cell-free RNAs is ubiquitous, with experiment-specific variations
               in composition and magnitude. We present a method, SoupX, for
               quantifying the extent of the contamination and estimating
               ``background-corrected'' cell expression profiles that seamlessly
               integrate with existing downstream analysis tools. Applying this
               method to several datasets using multiple droplet sequencing
               technologies, we demonstrate that its application improves
               biological interpretation of otherwise misleading data, as well
               as improving quality control metrics. CONCLUSIONS: We present
               SoupX, a tool for removing ambient RNA contamination from
               droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. This tool
               has broad applicability, and its application can improve the
               biological utility of existing and future datasets.},

              Pinpointing which enhancer variants contribute to changes in gene
              expression and phenotypes is a major challenge. Here, we find that
              suboptimal or low-affinity binding sites are necessary for precise

              cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes, a SNV within a human GATA4

              enhancers creates a vulnerability whereby affinity-optimizing SNVs
              can lead to GOF gene expression, changes in cellular identity, and
              organismal-level phenotypes that could contribute to the evolution

              accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide
              insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is
              systematically associated with specific trans-factors and

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease
              characterized by pancreatic islet dysfunction, insulin resistance,
              and disruption of blood glucose levels. Genome-wide association
              studies (GWAS) have identified > 400 independent signals that
              encode genetic predisposition. More than 90\% of associated
              single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) localize to non-coding
              regions and are enriched in chromatin-defined islet enhancer
              elements, indicating a strong transcriptional regulatory component
              to disease susceptibility. Pancreatic islets are a mixture of cell
              types that express distinct hormonal programs, so each cell type
              may contribute differentially to the underlying regulatory
              processes that modulate T2D-associated transcriptional circuits.
              Existing chromatin profiling methods such as ATAC-seq and
              DNase-seq, applied to islets in bulk, produce aggregate profiles
              that mask important cellular and regulatory heterogeneity.
              METHODS: We present genome-wide single-cell chromatin
              accessibility profiles in >1,600 cells derived from a human
              pancreatic islet sample using single-cell combinatorial indexing
              ATAC-seq (sci-ATAC-seq). We also developed a deep learning model
              based on U-Net architecture to accurately predict open chromatin
              peak calls in rare cell populations. RESULTS: We show that
              sci-ATAC-seq profiles allow us to deconvolve alpha, beta, and
              delta cell populations and identify cell-type-specific regulatory
              signatures underlying T2D. Particularly, T2D GWAS SNPs are
              significantly enriched in beta cell-specific and across cell-type
              shared islet open chromatin, but not in alpha or delta
              cell-specific open chromatin. We also demonstrate, using less
              abundant delta cells, that deep learning models can improve signal
              recovery and feature reconstruction of rarer cell populations.
              Finally, we use co-accessibility measures to nominate the
              cell-specific target genes at 104 non-coding T2D GWAS signals.
              CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we identify the islet cell type of
              action across genetic signals of T2D predisposition and provide

               challenging. Recent efforts have demonstrated that cell-type
               specific epigenomic features can be resolved in complex tissues
               using single-cell assays. However, it remains unclear whether
               single-cell chromatin conformation capture (3C) or Hi-C profiles
               can effectively identify cell types and reconstruct cell-type
               specific chromatin conformation maps. To address these
               challenges, we have developed single-nucleus methyl-3C
               sequencing to capture chromatin organization and DNA methylation
               information and robustly separate heterogeneous cell types.
               Applying this method to >4,200 single human brain prefrontal

               conformation maps from 14 cortical cell types. These datasets

               gene methylation is highly correlated with transcription levels.
               However, plants have different types of methylation controlled
               by different genetic pathways, and detailed information on the
               methylation status of each cytosine in any given genome is
               lacking. To this end, we generated a map at single-base-pair

              Primed enhancers are enriched for signal-dependent TF motifs and

              elements in the constuction of more complex descriptors of
              sequence features such as position weight matrices. k-mers are
              very useful as general sequence features because they constitute a

              mechanisms. However, a fundamental limitation in the use of k-mers
              as sequence features is that as k is increased, larger spatial
              correlations in DNA sequence elements can be described, but the
              frequency of observing any specific k-mer becomes very small, and
              rapidly approaches a sparse matrix of binary counts. Thus any

              Because all molecular DNA interactions have limited spatial
              extent, gapped k-mers often carry the relevant biological signal.
              Here we use gapped k-mer counts to more robustly estimate the

               PDK4. PRL reduced PDK2 mRNA and protein levels in rat islets and

	abstract = {Pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction plays an important role in the
              pathogenesis of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Insulin, which is
              produced in beta-cells, is a critical regulator of metabolism.
              Insulin is synthesized as preproinsulin and processed to
              proinsulin. Proinsulin is then converted to insulin and C-peptide
              and stored in secretary granules awaiting release on demand.
              Insulin synthesis is regulated at both the transcriptional and
              translational level. The cis-acting sequences within the 5'
              flanking region and trans-activators including paired box gene 6
              (PAX6), pancreatic and duodenal homeobox- 1(PDX-1), MafA, and
              beta-2/Neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1) regulate insulin
              transcription, while the stability of preproinsulin mRNA and its
              untranslated regions control protein translation. Insulin
              secretion involves a sequence of events in beta-cells that lead to
              fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane. Insulin is
              secreted primarily in response to glucose, while other nutrients
              such as free fatty acids and amino acids can augment
              glucose-induced insulin secretion. In addition, various hormones,
              such as melatonin, estrogen, leptin, growth hormone, and glucagon
              like peptide-1 also regulate insulin secretion. Thus, the beta-cell
              is a metabolic hub in the body, connecting nutrient metabolism and
              the endocrine system. Although an increase in intracellular [Ca2+]
              is the primary insulin secretary signal, cAMP signaling- dependent
              mechanisms are also critical in the regulation of insulin
              secretion. This article reviews current knowledge on how beta-cells
              synthesize and secrete insulin. In addition, this review presents
              evidence that genetic and environmental factors can lead to
              hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and autoimmunity,
              resulting in beta-cell dysfunction, thereby triggering the

              perform exceptionally well in a variety of tasks, including
              biological sequence classification. Available implementations,
              however, are usually optimized for a particular task and difficult
              to reuse. To enable researchers to utilize these networks more
              easily, we implemented pysster, a Python package for training CNNs
              on biological sequence data. Sequences are classified by learning
              sequence and structure motifs and the package offers an automated
              hyper-parameter optimization procedure and options to visualize
              learned motifs along with information about their positional and
              class enrichment. The package runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU and
              provides a simple interface to train and evaluate a network with a
              handful lines of code. Using an RNA A-to-I editing dataset and
              cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-seq binding site

	abstract = {The use of evolutionary profiles to predict protein secondary
              structure, as well as other protein structural features, has been
              standard practice since the 1990s. Using profiles in the input of
              such predictors, in place or in addition to the sequence itself,
              leads to significantly more accurate predictions. While profiles
              can enhance structural signals, their role remains somewhat
              surprising as proteins do not use profiles when folding in vivo.
              Furthermore, the same sequence-based redundancy reduction
              protocols initially derived to train and evaluate sequence-based
              predictors, have been applied to train and evaluate profile-based
              predictors. This can lead to unfair comparisons since profiles may
              facilitate the bleeding of information between training and test
              sets. Here we use the extensively studied problem of secondary
              structure prediction to better evaluate the role of profiles and
              show that: (1) high levels of profile similarity between training
              and test proteins are observed when using standard sequence-based
              redundancy protocols; (2) the gain in accuracy for profile-based
              predictors, over sequence-based predictors, strongly relies on
              these high levels of profile similarity between training and test
              proteins; and (3) the overall accuracy of a profile-based
              predictor on a given protein dataset provides a biased measure
              when trying to estimate the actual accuracy of the predictor, or
              when comparing it to other predictors. We show, however, that this
              bias can be mitigated by implementing a new protocol (EVALpro)
              which evaluates the accuracy of profile-based predictors as a
              function of the profile similarity between training and test
              proteins. Such a protocol not only allows for a fair comparison of
              the predictors on equally hard or easy examples, but also reduces
              the impact of choosing a given similarity cutoff when selecting
              test proteins. The EVALpro program is available in the SCRATCH

              Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current
              approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and
              typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions
              (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response
              to dsDNA breaks. Here we report the development of 'base editing',
              a new approach to genome editing that enables the direct,
              irreversible conversion of one target DNA base into another in a
              programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone cleavage or
              a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a
              cytidine deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed
              with a guide RNA, do not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the
              direct conversion of cytidine to uridine, thereby effecting a C→T
              (or G→A) substitution. The resulting 'base editors' convert
              cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides, and
              can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to
              human disease. In four transformed human and murine cell lines,
              second- and third-generation base editors that fuse uracil
              glycosylase inhibitor, and that use a Cas9 nickase targeting the
              non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to
              favour desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent
              correction of ~15-75\% of total cellular DNA with minimal
              (typically ≤1\%) indel formation. Base editing expands the scope

              predicting RBP binding sites and accurate sequence and structure
              motifs detection. RESULTS: In this study, we propose a deep
              learning-based method, iDeepS, to simultaneously identify the
              binding sequence and structure motifs from RNA sequences using
              convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long
              short term memory network (BLSTM). We first perform one-hot
              encoding for both the sequence and predicted secondary structure,
              to enable subsequent convolution operations. To reveal the hidden
              binding knowledge from the observed sequences, the CNNs are
              applied to learn the abstract features. Considering the close
              relationship between sequence and predicted structures, we use the
              BLSTM to capture possible long range dependencies between binding
              sequence and structure motifs identified by the CNNs. Finally, the
              learned weighted representations are fed into a classification
              layer to predict the RBP binding sites. We evaluated iDeepS on
              verified RBP binding sites derived from large-scale representative
              CLIP-seq datasets. The results demonstrate that iDeepS can
              reliably predict the RBP binding sites on RNAs, and outperforms
              the state-of-the-art methods. An important advantage compared to
              other methods is that iDeepS can automatically extract both
              binding sequence and structure motifs, which will improve our
              understanding of the mechanisms of binding specificities of RBPs.
              CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the iDeepS method identifies the
              sequence and structure motifs to accurately predict RBP binding
              sites. iDeepS is available at https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS

              represent grades of intermediate complexity that reflect the

               equivalent test in the Biometrics Bulletin, December, 1945, but
               gave only a few points of the distribution of his statistic.
               Under the hypothesis $f = g$ the probability of obtaining a given
               $U$ in a sample of $n x's$ and $m y's$ is the solution of a
               certain recurrence relation involving $n$ and $m$. Using this
               recurrence relation tables have been computed giving the
               probability of $U$ for samples up to $n = m = 8$. At this point
               the distribution is almost normal. From the recurrence relation
               explicit expressions for the mean, variance, and fourth moment

               regulating pancreatic beta cell development is necessary to
               understand the pathology of diabetes mellitus (DM), which is
               characterized by the progressive reduction in insulin-producing beta
               cell mass. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can potentially offer an
               unlimited supply of functional beta cells for cellular therapy and
               disease modeling of DM. Homeobox protein NKX6.1 is a
               transcription factor (TF) that plays a critical role in
               pancreatic beta cell function and proliferation. In human pancreatic
               islet, NKX6.1 expression is exclusive to beta cells and is
               undetectable in other islet cells. Several reports showed that
               activation of NKX6.1 in PSC-derived pancreatic progenitors
               (MPCs), expressing PDX1 (PDX1+/NKX6.1+), warrants their future
               commitment to monohormonal beta cells. However, further
               differentiation of MPCs lacking NKX6.1 expression (PDX1+/NKX6.1-)
               results in an undesirable generation of non-functional
               polyhormonal beta cells. The importance of NKX6.1 as a crucial
               regulator in MPC specification into functional beta cells directs
               attentions to further investigating its mechanism and enhancing
               NKX6.1 expression as a means to increase beta cell function and
               mass. Here, we shed light on the role of NKX6.1 during pancreatic
               beta cell development and in directing the MPCs to functional
               monohormonal lineage. Furthermore, we address the transcriptional

               similar to alpha+beta (``winged'') helix-turn-helix DNA-binding
               proteins. The crystal structure of the PU.1 ETS domain complexed
               to a 16-base pair oligonucleotide revealed a pattern for DNA
               recognition from a novel loop-helix-loop architecture

               456-460). Correlation of this model with mutational analyses and
               chemical shift data on other ets proteins confirms this complex
               as a paradigm for ets DNA recognition. The second helix in the
               helix-turn-helix motif lies deep in the major groove with
               specific contacts with bases in both strands in the core
               sequence made by conserved residues in alpha3. On either side of
               this helix, two loops contact the phosphate backbone. The DNA is
               bent (8 degrees) but uniformly curved without distinct kinks.
               ETS domains bind DNA as a monomer yet make extensive DNA
               contacts over 30 A. DNA bending likely results from phosphate
               neutralization of the phosphate backbone in the minor groove by
               both loops in the loop-helix-loop motif. Contacts from these
               loops stabilize DNA bending and may mediate specific base
               interactions by inducing a bend toward the protein.},

               neural marker Otx as an entry point, we dissected the neural
               induction pathway in the simple embryos of Ciona intestinalis. We
               first isolated the regulatory element driving Otx expression in
               the prospective neural tissue, showed that this element directly
               responds to FGF signaling and that FGF9/16/20 acts as an
               endogenous neural inducer. Binding site analysis and gene loss of
               function established that FGF9/16/20 induces neural tissue in the
               ectoderm via a synergy between two maternal response factors.
               Ets1/2 mediates general FGF responsiveness, while the restricted
               activity of GATAa targets the neural program to the ectoderm.
               Thus, our study identifies an endogenous FGF neural inducer and
               its early downstream gene cascade. It also reveals a role for
               GATA factors in FGF signaling.},

               upregulating gene expression by targeting promoters or enhancers
               in a tissue/cell-type specific manner. Here, we describe an
               experimental framework that combines highly multiplexed
               perturbations with single-cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) to
               identify cell-type-specific, CRISPRa-responsive cis-regulatory
               elements and the gene(s) they regulate. Random combinations of
               many gRNAs are introduced to each of many cells, which are then
               profiled and partitioned into test and control groups to test
               for effect(s) of CRISPRa perturbations of both enhancers and
               promoters on the expression of neighboring genes. Applying this
               method to a library of 493 gRNAs targeting candidate
               cis-regulatory elements in both K562 cells and iPSC-derived
               excitatory neurons, we identify gRNAs capable of specifically
               upregulating intended target genes and no other neighboring
               genes within 1 Mb, including gRNAs yielding upregulation of six
               autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurodevelopmental disorder
               (NDD) risk genes in neurons. A consistent pattern is that the
               responsiveness of individual enhancers to CRISPRa is restricted
               by cell type, implying a dependency on either chromatin
               landscape and/or additional trans-acting factors for successful

               computational models that take DNA sequences as input and

               unravelling the complex combinatorial rules that govern
               cell-type-specific activities of enhancers. These models
               function as biological `oracles', capable of accurately
               predicting the activity of novel DNA sequences. By leveraging
               these oracles, DNA sequences can be optimized towards designed

	abstract = {Considerable progress towards an understanding of complex
              diseases has been made in recent years due to the development of
              high-throughput genotyping technologies. Using microarrays that
              contain millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
              Genome Wide Association Studies (GWASs) have identified SNPs that
              are associated with many complex diseases or traits. For example,
              as of February 2015, 2111 association studies have identified
              15,396 SNPs for various diseases and traits, with the number of
              identified SNP-disease/trait associations increasing rapidly in
              recent years. However, it has been difficult for researchers to
              understand disease risk from GWAS results. This is because most
              GWAS-identified SNPs are located in non-coding regions of the
              genome. It is important to consider that the GWAS-identified SNPs
              serve only as representatives for all SNPs in the same haplotype
              block, and it is equally likely that other SNPs in high linkage
              disequilibrium (LD) with the array-identified SNPs are causal for
              the disease. Because it was hoped that disease-associated coding
              variants would be identified if the true casual SNPs were known,
              investigators have expanded their analyses using LD calculation
              and fine-mapping. However, such analyses also identified
              risk-associated SNPs located in non-coding regions. Thus, the
              GWAS field has been left with the conundrum as to how a
              single-nucleotide change in a non-coding region could confer
              increased risk for a specific disease. One possible answer to
              this puzzle is that the variant SNPs cause changes in gene
              expression levels rather than causing changes in protein
              function. This review provides a description of (1) advances in
              genomic and epigenomic approaches that incorporate functional
              annotation of regulatory elements to prioritize the disease
              risk-associated SNPs that are located in non-coding regions of
              the genome for follow-up studies, (2) various computational tools
              that aid in identifying gene expression changes caused by the
              non-coding disease-associated SNPs, and (3) experimental

              strategically incorporating CREs in therapeutic or biotechnology

              innovations in deep neural network modeling of CRE activity

              massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) to design and

              the development of machine learning methods aimed at
              investigating important questions in genomics. Although the
              motivations for these methods vary, a task that is commonly
              adopted is that of profile prediction, where predictions are made
              for one or more forms of biochemical activity along the genome,
              for example, histone modification, chromatin accessibility, or
              protein binding. In this review, we give an overview of the
              research works performing profile prediction, define two broad
              categories of profile prediction tasks, and discuss the types of
              scientific questions that can be answered in each.},

	abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an
               integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression
               experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex
               experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
               the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
               has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential
               expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data.
               The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading,
               normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities
               of limma have been significantly expanded in two important
               directions. First, the package can now perform both differential
               expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing
               (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously
               restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as
               well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
               microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package
               is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression
               analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in
               terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order
               expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for
               biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This
               article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package,
               summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on
               recent enhancements and features that have not been previously

              EfficientNetV2-inspired convolutional network for modeling short
              gene regulatory regions. By approaching the sequence-to-expression
              regression problem as a soft classification task, LegNet secured
              first place for the autosome.org team in the DREAM 2022 challenge
              of predicting gene expression from gigantic parallel reporter
              assays. Using published data, here, we demonstrate that LegNet
              outperforms existing models and accurately predicts gene
              expression per se as well as the effects of single-nucleotide
              variants. Furthermore, we show how LegNet can be used in a

                   barrier to adoption in applications where interpretability
                   is essential. Here we present DeepLIFT (Deep Learning
                   Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output
                   prediction of a neural network on a specific input by
                   backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the
                   network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the
                   activation of each neuron to its 'reference activation' and
                   assigns contribution scores according to the difference. By
                   optionally giving separate consideration to positive and
                   negative contributions, DeepLIFT can also reveal
                   dependencies which are missed by other approaches. Scores
                   can be computed efficiently in a single backward pass. We

               differentiation of pancreatic endocrine progenitors. Isl-1
               remains expressed in all adult pancreatic endocrine lineages;
               however, its specific function in the postnatal pancreas is
               unclear. Here we determine whether Isl-1 plays a distinct role in
               the postnatal beta-cell by performing physiological and morphometric
               analyses of a tamoxifen-inducible, beta-cell-specific Isl-1
               loss-of-function mouse: Isl-1(L/L); Pdx1-CreER(Tm). Ablating
               Isl-1 in postnatal beta-cells reduced glucose tolerance without
               significantly reducing beta-cell mass or increasing beta-cell
               apoptosis. Rather, islets from Isl-1(L/L); Pdx1-CreER(Tm) mice
               showed impaired insulin secretion. To identify direct targets of
               Isl-1, we integrated high-throughput gene expression and Isl-1
               chromatin occupancy using islets from Isl-1(L/L); Pdx1-CreER(Tm)
               mice and betaTC3 insulinoma cells, respectively. Ablating Isl-1
               significantly affected the beta-cell transcriptome, including known
               targets Insulin and MafA as well as novel targets Pdx1 and
               Slc2a2. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and
               luciferase reporter assays, we found that Isl-1 directly occupies
               functional regulatory elements of Pdx1 and Slc2a2. Thus Isl-1 is
               essential for postnatal beta-cell function, directly regulates Pdx1
               and Slc2a2, and has a mature beta-cell cistrome distinct from that

              understanding the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms.
              Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently gained popularity in

               However, sifting through the millions of candidate variants in a
               personal genome or a cancer genome, to identify those that impact
               cis-regulatory function, remains a major challenge.
               Interpretation of noncoding genome variation benefits from
               explainable artificial intelligence to predict and interpret the
               impact of a mutation on gene regulation. Here we generate phased
               whole genomes with matched chromatin accessibility, histone
               modifications, and gene expression for 10 melanoma cell lines. We
               find that training a specialized deep learning model, called
               DeepMEL2, on melanoma chromatin accessibility data can capture
               the various regulatory programs of the melanocytic and
               mesenchymal-like melanoma cell states. This model outperforms
               motif-based variant scoring, as well as more generic deep
               learning models. We detect hundreds to thousands of
               allele-specific chromatin accessibility variants (ASCAVs) in each

               losses of transcription factor binding sites. A considerable
               fraction of ASCAVs are caused by changes in AP-1 binding, as
               confirmed by matched ChIP-seq data to identify allele-specific

              networks tend to learn, or extract, spatial features from the
              data. Within their application to genomic sequence data, these
              learned features are often visualized and interpreted by
              converting them to sequence logos; an information-based
              representation of the consensus nucleotide motif. The process to
              obtain such motifs, however, is done through post-training
              procedures which often discard the filter weights themselves and
              instead rely upon finding those sequences maximally correlated
              with the given filter. Moreover, the filters collectively learn
              motifs with high redundancy, often simply shifted representations
              of the same sequence. We propose a schema to learn sequence motifs
              directly through weight constraints and transformations such that
              the individual weights comprising the filter are directly
              interpretable as either position weight matrices (PWMs) or

              accessibility landscapes. However, these context-specific
              regulatory sequence models cannot generalize predictions across

              context-specific expression of trans-regulators to predict
              genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles across cellular

              region across training contexts can be a surprisingly powerful
              predictor. We leverage this feature and employ novel strategies

               FGF/Ets shortly after heart progenitor emergence. Combinatorial
               sequence analysis of these co-regulated genes generated a
               hypothetical regulatory code consisting of Ets binding sites
               associated with a specific co-motif, ATTA. Through extensive
               reporter analysis, we confirmed the functional importance of the
               ATTA co-motif in primary heart progenitor gene regulation. We
               then used the Ets/ATTA combination motif to successfully predict
               a number of additional heart progenitor gene regulatory elements,
               including an intronic element driving expression of the core
               conserved cardiac transcription factor, GATAa. This work
               significantly advances our understanding of the Ciona heart gene
               network. Furthermore, this work has begun to elucidate the
               precise regulatory architecture underlying the conserved, primary

               regulates cytoplasmic calcium (Ca(2+)(c)) required for insulin
               secretion in beta-cells. NCX1 is alternatively spliced, resulting
               in the expression of splice variants in different tissues such as
               NCX1.3 and -1.7 in beta-cells. As pharmacological inhibitors of
               NCX1 splice variants are in development, the pharmacological
               profile of beta-cell NCX1.3 and -1.7 and the cellular effects of
               NCX1 inhibition were investigated. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
               The patch-clamp technique was used to examine the pharmacological
               profile of the NCX1 inhibitor KB-R7943 on recombinant NCX1.3 and
               -1.7 activity. Ca(2+) imaging and membrane capacitance were used
               to assess the effects of KB-R7943 on Ca(2+)(c) and insulin
               secretion in mouse and human beta-cells and islets. RESULTS:
               NCX1.3 and -1.7 calcium extrusion (forward-mode) activity was
               approximately 16-fold more sensitive to KB-R7943 inhibition
               compared with cardiac NCX1.1 (IC(50s) = 2.9 and 2.4 vs. 43.0
               micromol/l, respectively). In single mouse/human beta-cells, 1
               micromol/l KB-R7943 increased insulin granule exocytosis but was
               without effect on alpha-cell glucagon granule exocytosis.
               KB-R7943 also augmented sulfonylurea and glucose-stimulated
               Ca(2+)(c) levels and insulin secretion in mouse and human islets,
               although KB-R7943 was without effect under nonstimulated
               conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Islet NCX1 splice variants display a
               markedly greater sensitivity to pharmacological inhibition than
               the cardiac NCX1.1 splice variant. NCX1 inhibition resulted in
               glucose-dependent increases in Ca(2+)(c) and insulin secretion in
               mouse and human islets. Thus, we identify beta-cell NCX1 splice
               variants as targets for the development of novel
               glucose-sensitive insulinotropic drugs for type 2 diabetes.},

              and how much genes should be expressed - has proven to be
              exceedingly complex. Recently, advances in the scale and
              resolution of functional genomics assays and machine learning have
              enabled substantial progress towards deciphering this code.
              However, the cis-regulatory code will probably never be solved if
              models are trained only on genomic sequences; regions of homology
              can easily lead to overestimation of predictive performance, and
              our genome is too short and has insufficient sequence diversity to
              learn all relevant parameters. Fortunately, randomly synthesized
              DNA sequences enable testing a far larger sequence space than

	abstract = {We describe a method, Hi-C, to comprehensively detect chromatin
               interactions in the mammalian nucleus. This method is based on
               Chromosome Conformation Capture, in which chromatin is
               crosslinked with formaldehyde, then digested, and re-ligated in
               such a way that only DNA fragments that are covalently linked
               together form ligation products. The ligation products contain
               the information of not only where they originated from in the
               genomic sequence but also where they reside, physically, in the
               3D organization of the genome. In Hi-C, a biotin-labeled
               nucleotide is incorporated at the ligation junction, enabling
               selective purification of chimeric DNA ligation junctions
               followed by deep sequencing. The compatibility of Hi-C with next
               generation sequencing platforms makes it possible to detect
               chromatin interactions on an unprecedented scale. This advance
               gives Hi-C the power to both explore the biophysical properties
               of chromatin as well as the implications of chromatin structure
               for the biological functions of the nucleus. A massively
               parallel survey of chromatin interaction provides the previously
               missing dimension of spatial context to other genomic studies.
               This spatial context will provide a new perspective to studies
               of chromatin and its role in genome regulation in normal
               conditions and in disease.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a commonly
               used algorithm for characterizing gene expression changes.
               However, the currently available tools used to perform GSEA have
               a limited ability to analyze large datasets, which is
               particularly problematic for the analysis of single-cell data. To
               overcome this limitation, we developed a GSEA package in Python
               (GSEApy), which could efficiently analyze large single-cell
               datasets. RESULTS: We present a package (GSEApy) that performs
               GSEA in either the command line or Python environment. GSEApy
               uses a Rust implementation to enable it to calculate the same
               enrichment statistic as GSEA for a collection of pathways. The
               Rust implementation of GSEApy is 3-fold faster than the Numpy
               version of GSEApy (v0.10.8) and uses >4-fold less memory. GSEApy
               also provides an interface between Python and Enrichr web
               services, as well as for BioMart. The Enrichr application
               programming interface enables GSEApy to perform
               over-representation analysis for an input gene list. Furthermore,
               GSEApy consists of several tools, each designed to facilitate a
               particular type of enrichment analysis. AVAILABILITY AND
               IMPLEMENTATION: The new GSEApy with Rust extension is deposited
               in PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/gseapy/. The GSEApy source code
               is freely available at https://github.com/zqfang/GSEApy. Also,

               accessibility and gene expression from eleven primary human islet
               samples cultured in vitro with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone
               at multiple doses and durations. We identified thousands of
               accessible chromatin sites and genes with significant changes in

               up-regulated in glucocorticoid signaling were prominently
               enriched for glucocorticoid receptor binding sites and
               up-regulated genes were enriched for ion transport and lipid

               immunity and metabolism by activating the transcription factor
               (TF) activity of glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Previous models
               have proposed that DNA binding motifs and sites of chromatin
               accessibility predetermine GR binding and activity. However,
               there are vast excesses of both features relative to the number
               of GR binding sites. Thus, these features alone are unlikely to
               account for the specificity of GR binding and activity. To
               identify genomic and epigenetic contributions to GR binding
               specificity and the downstream changes resultant from GR binding,
               we performed hundreds of genome-wide measurements of TF binding,
               epigenetic state, and gene expression across a 12-h time course
               of glucocorticoid exposure. We found that glucocorticoid
               treatment induces GR to bind to nearly all pre-established
               enhancers within minutes. However, GR binds to only a small
               fraction of the set of accessible sites that lack enhancer marks.
               Once GR is bound to enhancers, a combination of enhancer motif
               composition and interactions between enhancers then determines
               the strength and persistence of GR binding, which consequently
               correlates with dramatic shifts in enhancer activation. Over the
               course of several hours, highly coordinated changes in TF binding
               and histone modification occupancy occur specifically within
               enhancers, and these changes correlate with changes in the
               expression of nearby genes. Following GR binding, changes in the
               binding of other TFs precede changes in chromatin accessibility,
               suggesting that other TFs are also sensitive to genomic features

              underpins gene regulation in all organisms. Genetic variation in
              regulatory regions has been connected with diseases and diverse
              phenotypic traits1, but it remains challenging to distinguish
              variants that affect regulatory function2. Genomic DNase I
              footprinting enables the quantitative, nucleotide-resolution
              delineation of sites of transcription factor occupancy within
              native chromatin3-6. However, only a small fraction of such sites
              have been precisely resolved on the human genome sequence6. Here,
              to enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor
              footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from
              243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these
              data to delineate about 4.5 million compact genomic elements that
              encode transcription factor occupancy at nucleotide resolution. We
              map the fine-scale structure within about 1.6 million DNase
              I-hypersensitive sites and show that the overwhelming majority are
              populated by well-spaced sites of single transcription factor-DNA
              interaction. Cell-context-dependent cis-regulation is chiefly
              executed by wholesale modulation of accessibility at regulatory
              DNA rather than by differential transcription factor occupancy
              within accessible elements. We also show that the enrichment of
              genetic variants associated with diseases or phenotypic traits in
              regulatory regions1,7 is almost entirely attributable to variants
              within footprints, and that functional variants that affect
              transcription factor occupancy are nearly evenly partitioned
              between loss- and gain-of-function alleles. Unexpectedly, we find
              increased density of human genetic variation within transcription
              factor footprints, revealing an unappreciated driver of
              cis-regulatory evolution. Our results provide a framework for both

               circadian rhythms. Transcriptional responses to this hormonal
               signal are mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We
               determined GR binding throughout the human genome by using
               chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation DNA
               sequencing, and measured related changes in gene expression with
               mRNA sequencing in response to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone

               and 234 genes with significant changes in expression in response
               to DEX. This genomic census revealed striking differences between
               gene activation and repression by the GR. While genes activated
               with DEX treatment have GR bound within a median distance of 11
               kb from the transcriptional start site (TSS), the nearest GR
               binding for genes repressed with DEX treatment is a median of 146
               kb from the TSS, suggesting that DEX-mediated repression occurs
               independently of promoter-proximal GR binding. In addition to the
               dramatic differences in proximity of GR binding, we found
               differences in the kinetics of gene expression response for
               induced and repressed genes, with repression occurring

               but their identification is a challenge, and methods depend on
               indirect measures of activity. We developed a method termed
               STARR-seq to directly and quantitatively assess enhancer
               activity for millions of candidates from arbitrary sources of
               DNA, which enables screens across entire genomes. When applied
               to the Drosophila genome, STARR-seq identifies thousands of cell
               type-specific enhancers across a broad continuum of strengths,
               links differential gene expression to differences in enhancer
               activity, and creates a genome-wide quantitative enhancer map.
               This map reveals the highly complex regulation of transcription,
               with several independent enhancers for both developmental

               diabetes and persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy
               (PHHI). The first mouse model for PHHI has a conditional deletion
               of the gene encoding the winged-helix transcription factor Foxa2
               (Forkhead box a2, formerly Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta) in
               pancreatic beta cells. Using isolated islets, we found that Foxa2
               deficiency resulted in excessive insulin release in response to
               amino acids and complete loss of glucose-stimulated insulin
               secretion. Most PHHI cases are associated with mutations in SUR1
               (Sulfonylurea receptor 1) or KIR6.2 (Inward rectifier K(+)
               channel member 6.2), which encode the subunits of the

               Foxa2 dependent. We utilized expression profiling to identify
               additional targets of Foxa2. Strikingly, one of these genes,
               Hadhsc, encodes short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A
               dehydrogenase, deficiency of which has been shown to cause PHHI

               pancreatic beta-cell mass and its deregulation has been implicated
               in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We have previously
               shown that treatment of pancreatic beta-cells with the GLP1R
               (glucagon like peptide 1 receptor) agonist exendin-4 stimulates
               autophagic flux in a setting of chronic nutrient excess. The aim
               of this study was to identify the underlying pathways
               contributing to enhanced autophagic flux.Pancreatic beta-cells
               (INS-1E),mouse and human islets were treated with glucolipotoxic
               stress (0.5 mM palmitate and 25 mM glucose) in the presence of
               exendin-4. Consistent with our previous work, exendin-4
               stimulated autophagic flux. Using chemical inhibitors and siRNA
               knockdown, we identified RAPGEF4/EPAC2 (Rap guanine nucleotide
               exchange factor 4) and downstream calcium signaling to be
               essential for regulation of autophagic flux by exendin-4. This
               pathway was independent of AMPK and MTOR signaling. Further
               analysis identified PPP3/calcineurin and its downstream regulator
               TFEB (transcription factor EB) as key proteins mediating
               exendin-4 induced autophagy. Importantly, inhibition of this
               pathway prevented exendin-4-mediated cell survival and
               overexpression of TFEB mimicked the cell protective effects of
               exendin-4 in INS-1E and human islets. Moreover, treatment of
               db/db mice with exendin-4 for 21 days increased the expression of
               lysosomal markers within the pancreatic islets. Collectively our
               data identify the RAPGEF4/EPAC2-calcium-PPP3/calcineurin-TFEB
               axis as a key mediator of autophagic flux, lysosomal function and
               cell survival in pancreatic beta-cells. Pharmacological modulation

	abstract = {The developing heart contains an inner tube of specialized
               endothelium known as endocardium, which performs multiple
               essential functions. In spite of the essential role of the
               endocardium in heart development and function, the
               transcriptional pathways that regulate its development remain
               largely undefined. GATA4 is a zinc finger transcription factor
               that is expressed in multiple cardiovascular lineages and is
               required for endocardial cushion development and embryonic
               viability, but the transcriptional pathways upstream of Gata4 in
               the endocardium and its derivatives in the endocardial cushions
               are unknown. Here, we describe a distal enhancer from the mouse
               Gata4 gene that is briefly active in multiple cardiac lineages
               early in cardiac development but restricts to the endocardium
               where it remains active through cardiogenesis. The activity of
               this Gata4 cardiac enhancer in transgenic embryos and in cultured
               aortic endothelial cells is dependent on four ETS sites. To
               identify which ETS transcription factors might be involved in
               Gata4 regulation via the ETS sites in the enhancer, we determined
               the expression profile of 24 distinct ETS factors in embryonic
               mouse hearts. Among multiple ETS transcripts present, ETS1, FLI1,
               ETV1, ETV5, ERG, and ETV6 were the most abundant in the early
               embryonic heart. We found that ETS1, FLI1, and ERG were strongly
               expressed in the heart at embryonic day 8.5 and that ETS1 and ERG
               bound to the endogenous Gata4 enhancer in cultured endothelial
               cells. Thus, these studies define the ETS expression profile in
               the early embryonic heart and identify an ETS-dependent enhancer
               from the Gata4 locus.},

               glucose-inducible insulin secretion comparable with cultured
               normal mouse islet cells, whereas MIN7 cells do not. Both cell
               lines produce liver-type glucose transporter (GT) mRNA at high
               level. Brain-type GT mRNA is also present at considerable level
               in MIN7 cells, but is barely detectable in MIN6 cells, suggesting
               that exclusive expression of the liver-type GT is related to
               glucose-inducible insulin secretion. MIN6 cells do not express
               either major histocompatibility (MHC) class I or class II

              differences among training cell types. We propose Epiphany, a
              neural network to predict cell-type-specific Hi-C contact maps
              from five epigenomic tracks that are already available in hundreds
              of cell types and tissues: DNase I hypersensitive sites and
              ChIP-seq for CTCF, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and H3K4me3. Epiphany uses
              1D convolutional layers to learn local representations from the
              input tracks, a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM)
              layers to capture long term dependencies along the epigenome, as
              well as a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture to
              encourage contact map realism. To improve the usability of

              adversarial (i.a., a GAN) loss to enhance its ability to produce

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recent big data revolution in Genomics, coupled
              with the emergence of Deep Learning as a set of powerful machine
              learning methods, has shifted the standard practices of machine
              learning for Genomics. Even though Deep Learning methods such as
              Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks
              (RNNs) are becoming widespread in Genomics, developing and
              training such models is outside the ability of most researchers in
              the field. RESULTS: Here we present ENNGene-Easy Neural Network
              model building tool for Genomics. This tool simplifies training of
              custom CNN or hybrid CNN-RNN models on genomic data via an
              easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. ENNGene allows multiple
              input branches, including sequence, evolutionary conservation, and
              secondary structure, and performs all the necessary preprocessing
              steps, allowing simple input such as genomic coordinates. The
              network architecture is selected and fully customized by the user,
              from the number and types of the layers to each layer's precise
              set-up. ENNGene then deals with all steps of training and
              evaluation of the model, exporting valuable metrics such as
              multi-class ROC and precision-recall curve plots or TensorBoard
              log files. To facilitate interpretation of the predicted results,
              we deploy Integrated Gradients, providing the user with a
              graphical representation of an attribution level of each input
              position. To showcase the usage of ENNGene, we train multiple
              models on the RBP24 dataset, quickly reaching the state of the art
              while improving the performance on more than half of the proteins
              by including the evolutionary conservation score and tuning the
              network per protein. CONCLUSIONS: As the role of DL in big data
              analysis in the near future is indisputable, it is important to
              make it available for a broader range of researchers. We believe
              that an easy-to-use tool such as ENNGene can allow Genomics
              researchers without a background in Computational Sciences to
              harness the power of DL to gain better insights into and extract

               limitation that if the parameter k is increased to resolve
               longer features, the probability of observing any specific k-mer
               becomes very small, and k-mer counts approach a binary variable,

               historically been a valuable tool for identifying all different
               types of regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers,
               silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. This method
               utilizes DNase I to selectively digest nucleosome-depleted DNA
               (presumably by transcription factors), whereas DNA regions
               tightly wrapped in nucleosome and higher-order structures are
               more resistant. The traditional low-throughput method for

              the fundamental problems in genome research. Gene regulatory code
              is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant
              semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often
              fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios. RESULTS: To
              address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained
              bidirectional encoder represen-tation, named DNABERT, to capture
              global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences
              based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared
              DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide
              regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use,
              accuracy, and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained
              transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art
              performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites, and
              transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using
              small task-specific labelled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct
              visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic
              relationship within input sequences for better interpretability
              and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and
              functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate
              that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily
              applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We
              anticipate that the pre-trained DNABERT model can be fined tuned

               mechanism involving the transfer of a methyl group onto the C5
               position of the cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine. DNA
               methylation regulates gene expression by recruiting proteins
               involved in gene repression or by inhibiting the binding of
               transcription factor(s) to DNA. During development, the pattern
               of DNA methylation in the genome changes as a result of a
               dynamic process involving both de novo DNA methylation and
               demethylation. As a consequence, differentiated cells develop a
               stable and unique DNA methylation pattern that regulates
               tissue-specific gene transcription. In this chapter, we will
               review the process of DNA methylation and demethylation in the
               nervous system. We will describe the DNA (de)methylation
               machinery and its association with other epigenetic mechanisms

               postmitotic neurons still express DNA methyltransferases and
               components involved in DNA demethylation. Moreover, neuronal
               activity can modulate their pattern of DNA methylation in
               response to physiological and environmental stimuli. The precise
               regulation of DNA methylation is essential for normal cognitive
               function. Indeed, when DNA methylation is altered as a result of
               developmental mutations or environmental risk factors, such as
               drug exposure and neural injury, mental impairment is a common

              dividing the genomic sequences into training data, used to create
              the model, and test data, used to determine the model's
              performance on unseen data, fail to account for the widespread

              that influences model performance by rewarding overfitting of

              loci associated with glucose and insulin-related traits. We aimed
              to characterize 19 such loci using detailed measures of insulin
              processing, secretion, and sensitivity to help elucidate their
              role in regulation of glucose control, insulin secretion and/or
              action. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We investigated associations
              of loci identified by the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and
              Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) with circulating
              proinsulin, measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity from
              oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), euglycemic clamps, insulin
              suppression tests, or frequently sampled intravenous glucose
              tolerance tests in nondiabetic humans (n = 29,084). RESULTS The
              glucose-raising allele in MADD was associated with abnormal
              insulin processing (a dramatic effect on higher proinsulin levels,
              but no association with insulinogenic index) at extremely
              persuasive levels of statistical significance (P = 2.1 x 10(-71)).
              Defects in insulin processing and insulin secretion were seen in
              glucose-raising allele carriers at TCF7L2, SCL30A8, GIPR, and
              C2CD4B. Abnormalities in early insulin secretion were suggested in
              glucose-raising allele carriers at MTNR1B, GCK, FADS1, DGKB, and
              PROX1 (lower insulinogenic index; no association with proinsulin
              or insulin sensitivity). Two loci previously associated with
              fasting insulin (GCKR and IGF1) were associated with OGTT-derived
              insulin sensitivity indices in a consistent direction. CONCLUSIONS
              Genetic loci identified through their effect on hyperglycemia
              and/or hyperinsulinemia demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in
              associations with measures of insulin processing, secretion, and
              sensitivity. Our findings emphasize the importance of detailed
              physiological characterization of such loci for improved

              particularly important to have enormous benefit for biology
              research. Various DNA sequences should have a great variety of
              representations, and specific functions may focus on corresponding
              features in the front part of learning model. Currently, however,
              for multi-class prediction of non-coding DNA regulatory functions,
              most powerful predictive models do not have appropriate feature
              extraction and selection approaches for specific functional

              we propose a hybrid deep neural network method, called DeepATT,

              recurrent layer captures a regulatory grammar, category attention
              layer selects corresponding valid features for different functions
              and category dense layer classifies predictive labels with

              mutagenesis and profiled > 140 million promoter-proximal

              gene expression and ab initio prediction of mutation disease

               so far are designed to address a specific question on a fixed
               dataset and/or by a fixed model architecture. Here we present
               Janggu, a python library facilitates deep learning for genomics
               applications, aiming to ease data acquisition and model
               evaluation. Among its key features are special dataset objects,
               which form a unified and flexible data acquisition and
               pre-processing framework for genomics data that enables
               streamlining of future research applications through reusable
               components. Through a numpy-like interface, these dataset objects
               are directly compatible with popular deep learning libraries,
               including keras or pytorch. Janggu offers the possibility to
               visualize predictions as genomic tracks or by exporting them to
               the bigWig format as well as utilities for keras-based models. We
               illustrate the functionality of Janggu on several deep learning
               genomics applications. First, we evaluate different model
               topologies for the task of predicting binding sites for the
               transcription factor JunD. Second, we demonstrate the framework
               on published models for predicting chromatin effects. Third, we
               show that promoter usage measured by CAGE can be predicted using
               DNase hypersensitivity, histone modifications and DNA sequence
               features. We improve the performance of these models due to a
               novel feature in Janggu that allows us to include high-order
               sequence features. We believe that Janggu will help to
               significantly reduce repetitive programming overhead for deep

              important, but challenging task in the broad field of genomics.
              This task is particularly difficult for non-coding DNA, the vast
              majority of which is still poorly understood in terms of function.
              A powerful predictive model for the function of non-coding DNA can
              have enormous benefit for both basic science and translational
              research because over 98\% of the human genome is non-coding and
              93\% of disease-associated variants lie in these regions. To
              address this need, we propose DanQ, a novel hybrid convolutional
              and bi-directional long short-term memory recurrent neural network
              framework for predicting non-coding function de novo from
              sequence. In the DanQ model, the convolution layer captures
              regulatory motifs, while the recurrent layer captures long-term
              dependencies between the motifs in order to learn a regulatory
              'grammar' to improve predictions. DanQ improves considerably upon
              other models across several metrics. For some regulatory markers,
              DanQ can achieve over a 50\% relative improvement in the area
              under the precision-recall curve metric compared to related
              models. We have made the source code available at the github

               which multiple GWAS loci contain genes that act in the same
               biological pathway1-6. However, our knowledge of which genes act
               in which pathways is incomplete, particularly for

               introduce a method to connect GWAS variants to functions. This
               method links variants to genes using epigenomics data, links
               genes to pathways de novo using Perturb-seq and integrates these
               data to identify convergence of GWAS loci onto pathways. We apply
               this approach to study the role of endothelial cells in genetic

	abstract = {Transcriptional enhancers act as docking stations for combinations
              of transcription factors and thereby regulate spatiotemporal
              activation of their target genes. A single enhancer, of a few
              hundred base pairs in length, can autonomously and independently
              of its location and orientation drive cell-type specific
              expression of a gene or transgene. It has been a long-standing
              goal in the field to decode the regulatory logic of an enhancer
              and to understand the details of how spatiotemporal gene
              expression is encoded in an enhancer sequence. Recently, deep
              learning models have yielded unprecedented insight into the
              enhancer code, and well-trained models are reaching a level of
              understanding that may be close to complete. As a consequence, we
              hypothesized that deep learning models can be used to guide the
              directed design of synthetic, cell type specific enhancers, and
              that this process would allow for a detailed tracing of all
              enhancer features at nucleotide-level resolution. Here we
              implemented and compared three different design strategies, each
              built on a deep learning model: (1) directed sequence evolution;
              (2) directed iterative motif implanting; and (3) generative
              design. We evaluated the function of fully synthetic enhancers to
              specifically target Kenyon cells in the fruit fly brain using
              transgenic animals. We then exploited this concept further by
              creating ``dual-code'' enhancers that target two cell types, and
              minimal enhancers smaller than 50 base pairs that are fully
              functional. By examining the trajectories followed during state
              space searches towards functional enhancers, we could accurately
              define the enhancer code as the optimal strength, combination, and
              relative distance of TF activator motifs, and the absence of TF
              repressor motifs. Finally, we applied the same three strategies to
              successfully design human enhancers. In conclusion, enhancer
              design guided by deep learning leads to better understanding of
              how enhancers work and shows that their code can be exploited to
              manipulate cell states. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The

               fates in response to ephrin and FGF signals during ascidian
               neural induction. In each ectoderm cell, FGF signals activate ERK

               FGF-expressing mesendoderm cells. This gradual interpretation of
               FGF inputs is followed by a bimodal transcriptional response of
               the immediate early gene, Otx, resulting in its activation
               specifically in the neural precursors. At low levels of ERK, Otx
               is repressed by an ETS family transcriptional repressor, ERF2.
               Ephrin signals are critical for dampening ERK activation levels
               across ectoderm cells so that only neural precursors exhibit

               directional long range contact sites at high resolution. We

	abstract = {Summary Enhancers direct precise gene expression patterns during
              development and harbor the majority of variants associated with
              disease. We find that suboptimal affinity ETS transcription
              factor binding sites are prevalent within Ciona and human
              developmental heart enhancers. Here we demonstrate in two diverse
              systems, Ciona intestinalis and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes
              (iPSC-CMs), that single nucleotide changes can optimize the
              affinity of ETS binding sites, leading to gain-of-function gene
              expression associated with heart phenotypes. In Ciona, ETS
              affinity-optimizing SNVs lead to ectopic expression and
              phenotypic changes including two beating hearts. In human
              iPSC-CMs, an affinity-optimizing SNV associated with QRS duration
              occurs within an SCN5A enhancer and leads to increased enhancer
              activity. Our mechanistic approach provides a much-needed
              systematic framework that works across different enhancers, cell
              types and species to pinpoint causal enhancer variants
              contributing to enhanceropathies, phenotypic diversity and
              evolutionary changes.In Brief The prevalent use of low-affinity
              ETS sites within developmental heart enhancers creates
              vulnerability within genomes whereby single nucleotide changes
              can dramatically increase binding affinity, causing
              gain-of-function enhancer activity that impacts heart
              development.Highlights ETS affinity-optimizing SNVs can lead to
              migration defects and a multi-chambered heart.An ETS
              affinity-optimizing human SNV within an SCN5A enhancer increases
              expression and is associated with QRS duration.Searching for ETS

              learning represents one emerging strategy to model the regulatory
              grammar that relates CRE sequence to function. However, these
              models require training data on a scale that exceeds the number of

              learning to iteratively train models on multiple rounds of
              synthetic DNA sequences assayed in live mammalian retinas. During
              each round of training the model actively selects sequence
              perturbations to assay, thereby efficiently generating informative
              training data. We iteratively trained a model that predicts the
              activities of sequences containing binding motifs for the
              photoreceptor transcription factor Cone-rod homeobox (CRX) using
              an order of magnitude less training data than current approaches.
              The model's internal confidence estimates of its predictions are
              reliable guides for designing sequences with high activity. The

              identification of cell state shifts associated with experimental
              conditions. Other downstream analyses are further needed to
              annotate cell states, extract pathway-level activity metrics,
              and/or nominate gene regulatory drivers of cell-to-cell
              variability or cell state shifts. Existing methods address these
              analytical requirements sequentially, lacking a cohesive
              framework to unify them. Moreover, these analyses are currently
              confined to specific modalities where the biological quantity of
              interest gives rise to a singular measurement. However, other
              modalities require joint consideration of dual measurements; for
              example, modeling the latent space of alternative splicing
              involves joint analysis of exon inclusion and exclusion reads.
              Here, we introduce a generative model, called GEDI, to identify
              latent space variations in multi-sample, multi-condition single
              cell datasets and attribute them to sample-level covariates. GEDI
              enables cross-sample cell state mapping on par with the

              gene expression analysis along the continuum of cell states in
              the form of transcriptomic vector fields, and machine
              learning-based prediction of sample characteristics from
              single-cell data. By incorporating gene-level prior knowledge, it

              association with the transcriptomic vector fields of sample
              covariates. Finally, we demonstrate that GEDI surpasses the

              modifications, the binding of chromatin modifiers and
              transcription factors and cofactors, or chromatin accessibility.
              However, validating such candidates as bona fide enhancers
              requires functional characterization, typically achieved through
              reporter assays that test whether a sequence can increase
              expression of a transcriptional reporter via a minimal promoter.
              A longstanding concern is that reporter assays are mainly
              implemented on episomes, which are thought to lack physiological
              chromatin. However, the magnitude and determinants of differences
              in cis-regulation for regulatory sequences residing in episomes
              versus chromosomes remain almost completely unknown. To address
              this systematically, we developed and applied a novel
              lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA) to
              directly compare the functional activities of 2236 candidate
              liver enhancers in an episomal versus a chromosomally integrated
              context. We find that the activities of chromosomally integrated
              sequences are substantially different from the activities of the
              identical sequences assayed on episomes, and furthermore are
              correlated with different subsets of ENCODE annotations. The
              results of chromosomally based reporter assays are also more
              reproducible and more strongly predictable by both ENCODE
              annotations and sequence-based models. With a linear model that
              combines chromatin annotations and sequence information, we
              achieve a Pearson's R2 of 0.362 for predicting the results of
              chromosomally integrated reporter assays. This level of
              prediction is better than with either chromatin annotations or
              sequence information alone and also outperforms predictive models
              of episomal assays. Our results have broad implications for how

               activities, called sequence classes, using a deep learning model
               that predicts 21,907 chromatin profiles across >1,300 cell lines
               and tissues. Sequence classes provide a global classification and
               quantification of sequence and variant effects based on diverse
               regulatory activities, such as cell type-specific enhancer
               functions. These predictions are supported by tissue-specific
               expression, expression quantitative trait loci and evolutionary
               constraint data. Furthermore, sequence classes enable
               characterization of the tissue-specific, regulatory architecture
               of complex traits and generate mechanistic hypotheses for
               individual regulatory pathogenic mutations. We provide Sei as a
               resource to elucidate the regulatory basis of human health and
               disease. Sei is a new framework for integrating human genetics
               data with a sequence-based mapping of predicted regulatory
               activities to elucidate mechanisms contributing to complex traits
               and diseases.},

              complex biological phenomena such as gene expression. The value of
              these models hinges not only on their accuracy, but also on the
              ability to extract biologically relevant information from the
              trained models. While there has been much recent work on
              developing feature attribution methods that discover the most
              important features for a given sequence, inferring cooperativity
              between regulatory elements, which is the hallmark of phenomena
              such as gene expression, remains an open problem. We present
              SATORI, a Self-ATtentiOn based model to detect Regulatory element
              Interactions. Our approach combines convolutional layers with a
              self-attention mechanism that helps us capture a global view of
              the landscape of interactions between regulatory elements in a
              sequence. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the ability of
              SATORI to identify numerous statistically significant TF-TF
              interactions, many of which have been previously reported. Our
              method is able to detect higher numbers of experimentally verified
              TF-TF interactions than existing methods, and has the advantage of
              not requiring a computationally expensive post-processing step.
              Finally, SATORI can be used for detection of any type of feature
              interaction in models that use a similar attention mechanism, and
              is not limited to the detection of TF-TF interactions.},

               Centromeric regions display higher structural dynamics, and

               of regulatory elements coupled with high-throughput sequencing
               (FAIRE-seq). We identified approximately 80,000 open chromatin
               sites. Comparison of FAIRE-seq data from islets to that from five
               non-islet cell lines revealed approximately 3,300 physically
               linked clusters of islet-selective open chromatin sites, which
               typically encompassed single genes that have islet-specific

               tolerance tests, using up to 5,567 individuals without diabetes

               associations between common variants and glycemic traits and
               identify new loci. Thirty type 2 diabetes or fasting
               glucose-raising alleles were associated with a measure of
               first-phase insulin secretion at P < 0.05 and provided new
               evidence, or the strongest evidence yet, that insulin secretion,

               targeted oncogenesis in human fetal tissue. Human fetal
               pancreatic buds were transduced with a lentiviral vector that
               expressed SV40LT under the control of the insulin promoter. The
               transduced buds were then grafted into SCID mice so that they
               could develop into mature pancreatic tissue. Upon
               differentiation, the newly formed SV40LT-expressing beta cells
               proliferated and formed insulinomas. The resulting beta cells were
               then transduced with human telomerase reverse transcriptase

               comprehensively addressing cellular diversity across varied
               molecular modalities. Here we introduce a nonlinear
               dimensionality reduction algorithm, embodied in the Python
               package SnapATAC2, which not only achieves a more precise capture
               of single-cell omics data heterogeneities but also ensures
               efficient runtime and memory usage, scaling linearly with the
               number of cells. Our algorithm demonstrates exceptional
               performance, scalability and versatility across diverse
               single-cell omics datasets, including single-cell assay for
               transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing, single-cell
               RNA sequencing, single-cell Hi-C and single-cell multi-omics
               datasets, underscoring its utility in advancing single-cell
               analysis.},

              we report a systematic analysis of the RNA motifs recognized by
              RNA-binding proteins, encompassing 205 distinct genes from 24
              diverse eukaryotes. The sequence specificities of RNA-binding
              proteins display deep evolutionary conservation, and the
              recognition preferences for a large fraction of metazoan
              RNA-binding proteins can thus be inferred from their RNA-binding
              domain sequence. The motifs that we identify in vitro correlate
              well with in vivo RNA-binding data. Moreover, we can associate
              them with distinct functional roles in diverse types of
              post-transcriptional regulation, enabling new insights into the
              functions of RNA-binding proteins both in normal physiology and in

	abstract = {Our understanding of the maternal factors that initiate early
              chordate development, and of their direct zygotic targets, is
              still fragmentary. A molecular cascade is emerging for the
              mesendoderm, but less is known about the ectoderm, giving rise to
              epidermis and nervous tissue. Our cis-regulatory analysis
              surprisingly places the maternal transcription factor Ci-GATAa
              (GATA4/5/6) at the top of the ectodermal regulatory network in
              ascidians. Initially distributed throughout the embryo, Ci-GATAa
              activity is progressively repressed in vegetal territories by
              accumulating maternal beta-catenin. Once restricted to the animal
              hemisphere, Ci-GATAa directly activates two types of zygotic
              ectodermal genes. First, Ci-fog is activated from the 8-cell stage
              throughout the ectoderm, then Ci-otx is turned on from the 32-cell
              stage in neural precursors only. Whereas the enhancers of both
              genes contain critical and interchangeable GATA sites, their
              distinct patterns of activation stem from the additional presence
              of two Ets sites in the Ci-otx enhancer. Initially characterized
              as activating elements in the neural lineages, these Ets sites
              additionally act as repressors in non-neural lineages, and
              restrict GATA-mediated activation of Ci-otx. We thus identify a
              precise combinatorial code of maternal factors responsible for
              zygotic onset of a chordate ectodermal genetic program.},

@article{Khoueiry2010-eh,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcription initiation is controlled by
              cis-regulatory modules. Although these modules are usually made of
              clusters of short transcription factor binding sites, a small
              minority of such clusters in the genome have cis-regulatory
              activity. This paradox is currently unsolved. RESULTS: To identify
              what discriminates active from inactive clusters, we focused our
              attention on short topologically unconstrained clusters of two ETS
              and two GATA binding sites, similar to the early neural enhancer
              of Ciona intestinalis Otx. We first computationally identified 55
              such clusters, conserved between the two Ciona genomes. In vivo
              assay of the activity of 19 hits identified three novel early
              neural enhancers, all located next to genes coexpressed with Otx.
              Optimization of ETS and GATA binding sites was not always
              sufficient to confer activity to inactive clusters. Rather, a
              dinucleotide sequence code associated to nucleosome depletion
              showed a robust correlation with enhancer potential.
              Identification of a large collection of Ciona regulatory regions
              revealed that predicted nucleosome depletion constitutes a general
              signature of Ciona enhancers, which is conserved between
              orthologous loci in the two Ciona genomes and which partitions
              conserved noncoding sequences into a major nucleosome-bound
              fraction and a minor nucleosome-free fraction with higher
              cis-regulatory potential. We also found this signature in a large
              fraction of short Drosophila cis-regulatory modules. CONCLUSION:
              This study indicates that a sequence-based dinucleotide signature,
              previously associated with nucleosome depletion and independent of
              transcription factor binding sites, contributes to the definition
              of a local cis-regulatory potential in two metazoa, Ciona
              intestinalis and Drosophila melanogaster.},

               alterations on chromosomes and extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA),
               making it difficult to identify non-coding enhancer regions that
               are hijacked to activate oncogene expression. Here, we describe
               a 3D genomics-based analysis called HAPI (Highly Active Promoter
               Interactions) to characterize enhancer hijacking. HAPI analysis
               of HiChIP data from 34 cancer cell lines identified enhancer
               hijacking events that activate both known and potentially novel
               oncogenes such as MYC, CCND1, ETV1, CRKL, and ID4. Furthermore,
               we found enhancer hijacking among multiple oncogenes from
               different chromosomes, often including MYC, on the same complex
               amplicons such as ecDNA. We characterized a MYC-ERBB2 chimeric
               ecDNA, in which ERBB2 heavily hijacks MYC's enhancers. Notably,
               CRISPRi of the MYC promoter led to increased interaction of
               ERBB2 with MYC enhancers and elevated ERBB2 expression. Our HAPI
               analysis tool provides a robust strategy to detect enhancer
               hijacking and reveals novel insights into oncogene activation.
               Here the authors describe a 3D genomic strategy that uncovers
               novel enhancer hijacking events, including a MYC-ERBB2 chimeric
