  abstract      = "We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order
                   gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective
                   functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
                   moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is
                   computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is
                   invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well
                   suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or
                   parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
                   objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse
                   gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive
                   interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some
                   connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was
                   inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical
                   convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret
                   bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best
                   known results under the online convex optimization framework.
                   Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in
                   practice and compares favorably to other stochastic
                   optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant
                   of Adam based on the infinity norm.",

               immunity and metabolism by activating the transcription factor
               (TF) activity of glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Previous models
               have proposed that DNA binding motifs and sites of chromatin
               accessibility predetermine GR binding and activity. However,
               there are vast excesses of both features relative to the number
               of GR binding sites. Thus, these features alone are unlikely to
               account for the specificity of GR binding and activity. To
               identify genomic and epigenetic contributions to GR binding
               specificity and the downstream changes resultant from GR binding,
               we performed hundreds of genome-wide measurements of TF binding,
               epigenetic state, and gene expression across a 12-h time course
               of glucocorticoid exposure. We found that glucocorticoid
               treatment induces GR to bind to nearly all pre-established
               enhancers within minutes. However, GR binds to only a small
               fraction of the set of accessible sites that lack enhancer marks.
               Once GR is bound to enhancers, a combination of enhancer motif
               composition and interactions between enhancers then determines
               the strength and persistence of GR binding, which consequently
               correlates with dramatic shifts in enhancer activation. Over the
               course of several hours, highly coordinated changes in TF binding
               and histone modification occupancy occur specifically within
               enhancers, and these changes correlate with changes in the
               expression of nearby genes. Following GR binding, changes in the
               binding of other TFs precede changes in chromatin accessibility,
               suggesting that other TFs are also sensitive to genomic features
               beyond that of accessibility.",

               regulates cytoplasmic calcium (Ca(2+)(c)) required for insulin
               secretion in beta-cells. NCX1 is alternatively spliced, resulting
               in the expression of splice variants in different tissues such as
               NCX1.3 and -1.7 in beta-cells. As pharmacological inhibitors of
               NCX1 splice variants are in development, the pharmacological
               profile of beta-cell NCX1.3 and -1.7 and the cellular effects of
               NCX1 inhibition were investigated. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:
               The patch-clamp technique was used to examine the pharmacological
               profile of the NCX1 inhibitor KB-R7943 on recombinant NCX1.3 and
               -1.7 activity. Ca(2+) imaging and membrane capacitance were used
               to assess the effects of KB-R7943 on Ca(2+)(c) and insulin
               secretion in mouse and human beta-cells and islets. RESULTS:
               NCX1.3 and -1.7 calcium extrusion (forward-mode) activity was
               approximately 16-fold more sensitive to KB-R7943 inhibition
               compared with cardiac NCX1.1 (IC(50s) = 2.9 and 2.4 vs. 43.0
               micromol/l, respectively). In single mouse/human beta-cells, 1
               micromol/l KB-R7943 increased insulin granule exocytosis but was
               without effect on alpha-cell glucagon granule exocytosis.
               KB-R7943 also augmented sulfonylurea and glucose-stimulated
               Ca(2+)(c) levels and insulin secretion in mouse and human islets,
               although KB-R7943 was without effect under nonstimulated
               conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Islet NCX1 splice variants display a
               markedly greater sensitivity to pharmacological inhibition than
               the cardiac NCX1.1 splice variant. NCX1 inhibition resulted in
               glucose-dependent increases in Ca(2+)(c) and insulin secretion in
               mouse and human islets. Thus, we identify beta-cell NCX1 splice
               variants as targets for the development of novel
               glucose-sensitive insulinotropic drugs for type 2 diabetes.",

               targeted oncogenesis in human fetal tissue. Human fetal
               pancreatic buds were transduced with a lentiviral vector that
               expressed SV40LT under the control of the insulin promoter. The
               transduced buds were then grafted into SCID mice so that they
               could develop into mature pancreatic tissue. Upon
               differentiation, the newly formed SV40LT-expressing β cells
               proliferated and formed insulinomas. The resulting β cells were
               then transduced with human telomerase reverse transcriptase
               (hTERT), grafted into other SCID mice, and finally expanded in
               vitro to generate cell lines. One of these cell lines, EndoC-βH1,
               expressed many β cell-specific markers without any substantial

               underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we
               demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative
               interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of
               macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors
               establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with
               the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions.
               PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4
               monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated
               with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These
               locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by
               liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression
               and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of
               transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell

               regulating pancreatic β cell development is necessary to
               understand the pathology of diabetes mellitus (DM), which is
               characterized by the progressive reduction in insulin-producing β
               cell mass. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can potentially offer an
               unlimited supply of functional β cells for cellular therapy and
               disease modeling of DM. Homeobox protein NKX6.1 is a
               transcription factor (TF) that plays a critical role in
               pancreatic β cell function and proliferation. In human pancreatic
               islet, NKX6.1 expression is exclusive to β cells and is
               undetectable in other islet cells. Several reports showed that
               activation of NKX6.1 in PSC-derived pancreatic progenitors
               (MPCs), expressing PDX1 (PDX1+/NKX6.1+), warrants their future

               NKX6.1 expression as a means to increase β cell function and

               used algorithm for characterizing gene expression changes.
               However, the currently available tools used to perform GSEA have
               a limited ability to analyze large datasets, which is
               particularly problematic for the analysis of single-cell data. To
               overcome this limitation, we developed a GSEA package in Python
               (GSEApy), which could efficiently analyze large single-cell
               datasets. RESULTS: We present a package (GSEApy) that performs
               GSEA in either the command line or Python environment. GSEApy
               uses a Rust implementation to enable it to calculate the same
               enrichment statistic as GSEA for a collection of pathways. The
               Rust implementation of GSEApy is 3-fold faster than the Numpy
               version of GSEApy (v0.10.8) and uses >4-fold less memory. GSEApy
               also provides an interface between Python and Enrichr web
               services, as well as for BioMart. The Enrichr application
               programming interface enables GSEApy to perform
               over-representation analysis for an input gene list. Furthermore,
               GSEApy consists of several tools, each designed to facilitate a
               particular type of enrichment analysis. AVAILABILITY AND

               chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation DNA
               sequencing, and measured related changes in gene expression with
               mRNA sequencing in response to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone
               (DEX). We identified 4392 genomic positions occupied by the GR
               and 234 genes with significant changes in expression in response
               to DEX. This genomic census revealed striking differences between
               gene activation and repression by the GR. While genes activated
               with DEX treatment have GR bound within a median distance of 11
               kb from the transcriptional start site (TSS), the nearest GR
               binding for genes repressed with DEX treatment is a median of 146

               pancreatic β-cell mass and its deregulation has been implicated
               in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We have previously
               shown that treatment of pancreatic β-cells with the GLP1R
               (glucagon like peptide 1 receptor) agonist exendin-4 stimulates
               autophagic flux in a setting of chronic nutrient excess. The aim
               of this study was to identify the underlying pathways
               contributing to enhanced autophagic flux.Pancreatic β-cells
               (INS-1E),mouse and human islets were treated with glucolipotoxic
               stress (0.5 mM palmitate and 25 mM glucose) in the presence of
               exendin-4. Consistent with our previous work, exendin-4
               stimulated autophagic flux. Using chemical inhibitors and siRNA
               knockdown, we identified RAPGEF4/EPAC2 (Rap guanine nucleotide
               exchange factor 4) and downstream calcium signaling to be
               essential for regulation of autophagic flux by exendin-4. This
               pathway was independent of AMPK and MTOR signaling. Further
               analysis identified PPP3/calcineurin and its downstream regulator
               TFEB (transcription factor EB) as key proteins mediating
               exendin-4 induced autophagy. Importantly, inhibition of this
               pathway prevented exendin-4-mediated cell survival and
               overexpression of TFEB mimicked the cell protective effects of
               exendin-4 in INS-1E and human islets. Moreover, treatment of
               db/db mice with exendin-4 for 21 days increased the expression of
               lysosomal markers within the pancreatic islets. Collectively our
               data identify the RAPGEF4/EPAC2-calcium-PPP3/calcineurin-TFEB
               axis as a key mediator of autophagic flux, lysosomal function and

               diabetes (T2D) remains limited. Only a few studies have
               investigated DNA methylation of selected candidate genes or a
               very small fraction of genomic CpG sites in human pancreatic
               islets, the tissue of primary pathogenic importance for diabetes.
               Our aim was to characterize the whole-genome DNA methylation
               landscape in human pancreatic islets, to identify differentially
               methylated regions (DMRs) in diabetic islets, and to investigate
               the function of DMRs in islet biology. Here, we performed
               whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, which is a comprehensive and
               unbiased method to study DNA methylation throughout the genome at
               a single nucleotide resolution, in pancreatic islets from donors
               with T2D and control subjects without diabetes. We identified
               25,820 DMRs in islets from individuals with T2D. These DMRs cover
               loci with known islet function, e.g., PDX1, TCF7L2, and ADCY5
               Importantly, binding sites previously identified by ChIP-seq for
               islet-specific transcription factors, enhancer regions, and
               different histone marks were enriched in the T2D-associated DMRs.
               We also identified 457 genes, including NR4A3, PARK2, PID1,
               SLC2A2, and SOCS2, that had both DMRs and significant expression
               changes in T2D islets. To mimic the situation in T2D islets,
               candidate genes were overexpressed or silenced in cultured
               β-cells. This resulted in impaired insulin secretion, thereby
               connecting differential methylation to islet dysfunction. We
               further explored the islet methylome and found a strong link
               between methylation levels and histone marks. Additionally, DNA
               methylation in different genomic regions and of different
               transcript types (i.e., protein coding, noncoding, and
               pseudogenes) was associated with islet expression levels. Our
               study provides a comprehensive picture of the islet DNA methylome
               in individuals with and without diabetes and highlights the

               (Forkhead box a2, formerly Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta) in

               secretion. Most PHHI cases are associated with mutations in SUR1
               (Sulfonylurea receptor 1) or KIR6.2 (Inward rectifier K(+)

              to enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor
              footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from
              243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these
              data to delineate about 4.5 million compact genomic elements that

              map the fine-scale structure within about 1.6 million DNase

              tasks, including understanding cis-regulatory syntax and
              interpreting non-coding genetic variants. However, current
              state-of-the-art models have been trained largely on bulk

              161 cell clusters with distinct spatial locations and projection

              Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current
              approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and
              typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions
              (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response
              to dsDNA breaks. Here we report the development of 'base editing',
              a new approach to genome editing that enables the direct,
              irreversible conversion of one target DNA base into another in a
              programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone cleavage or
              a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a
              cytidine deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed
              with a guide RNA, do not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the
              direct conversion of cytidine to uridine, thereby effecting a C→T
              (or G→A) substitution. The resulting 'base editors' convert
              cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides, and
              can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to
              human disease. In four transformed human and murine cell lines,
              second- and third-generation base editors that fuse uracil
              glycosylase inhibitor, and that use a Cas9 nickase targeting the
              non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to
              favour desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent
              correction of ~15-75\% of total cellular DNA with minimal
              (typically ≤1\%) indel formation. Base editing expands the scope

              specific causal variants underlying a genetic association signal
              remains challenging. In this study, we describe a deep learning
              method to analyze the impact of sequence variants on enhancers.
              Focusing on pancreatic islets, a T2D relevant tissue, we show that
              our model learns islet-specific transcription factor (TF)
              regulatory patterns and can be used to prioritize candidate causal
              variants. At 101 genetic signals associated with T2D and related
              glycemic traits where multiple variants occur in linkage
              disequilibrium, our method nominates a single causal variant for
              each association signal, including three variants previously shown

              another signal associated with blood glucose levels, we

              characterized by pancreatic islet dysfunction, insulin resistance,
              and disruption of blood glucose levels. Genome-wide association
              studies (GWAS) have identified > 400 independent signals that
              encode genetic predisposition. More than 90\% of associated
              single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) localize to non-coding
              regions and are enriched in chromatin-defined islet enhancer
              elements, indicating a strong transcriptional regulatory component
              to disease susceptibility. Pancreatic islets are a mixture of cell
              types that express distinct hormonal programs, so each cell type
              may contribute differentially to the underlying regulatory
              processes that modulate T2D-associated transcriptional circuits.
              Existing chromatin profiling methods such as ATAC-seq and
              DNase-seq, applied to islets in bulk, produce aggregate profiles
              that mask important cellular and regulatory heterogeneity.
              METHODS: We present genome-wide single-cell chromatin
              accessibility profiles in >1,600 cells derived from a human
              pancreatic islet sample using single-cell combinatorial indexing
              ATAC-seq (sci-ATAC-seq). We also developed a deep learning model
              based on U-Net architecture to accurately predict open chromatin
              peak calls in rare cell populations. RESULTS: We show that
              sci-ATAC-seq profiles allow us to deconvolve alpha, beta, and
              delta cell populations and identify cell-type-specific regulatory
              signatures underlying T2D. Particularly, T2D GWAS SNPs are
              significantly enriched in beta cell-specific and across cell-type
              shared islet open chromatin, but not in alpha or delta
              cell-specific open chromatin. We also demonstrate, using less
              abundant delta cells, that deep learning models can improve signal
              recovery and feature reconstruction of rarer cell populations.
              Finally, we use co-accessibility measures to nominate the
              cell-specific target genes at 104 non-coding T2D GWAS signals.
              CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we identify the islet cell type of
              action across genetic signals of T2D predisposition and provide
              higher-resolution mechanistic insights into genetically encoded
              risk pathways.",

               phosphorylation and inactivation of PDH. PRL increased GSIS by
               37\% (P < 0.001) in rat islets. Glucose at supraphysiological
               concentrations (11 mm) increased PC mRNA in islets; in contrast,
               PRL suppressed PC mRNA levels in islets and INS-1 cells, whereas
               DEX was without effect. Neither PRL nor DEX altered PC protein or
               activity levels. In INS-1 cells, PRL increased PDH activity 1.4-
               to 2-fold (P < 0.05-0.001) at glucose concentrations ranging from
               2.5-11 mm. DEX reduced PDH activity; this effect was reversed by
               PRL. PDK1, -2, -3, and -4 mRNAs were detected in both islets and
               insulinoma cells, but the latter expressed trivial amounts of
               PDK4. PRL reduced PDK2 mRNA and protein levels in rat islets and
               INS-1 cells and PDK4 mRNA in islets; DEX increased PDK2 mRNA in
               islets and INS-1 cells; this effect was reversed by PRL. Our
               findings suggest that PRL induction of GSIS is mediated by
               increases in beta-cell PDH activity; this is facilitated by
               suppression of PDKs. PRL counteracts the effects of DEX on PDH
               and PDK expression, suggesting novel roles for the lactogens in

               the postnatal β-cell by performing physiological and morphometric
               analyses of a tamoxifen-inducible, β-cell-specific Isl-1
               loss-of-function mouse: Isl-1(L/L); Pdx1-CreER(Tm). Ablating
               Isl-1 in postnatal β-cells reduced glucose tolerance without
               significantly reducing β-cell mass or increasing β-cell
               apoptosis. Rather, islets from Isl-1(L/L); Pdx1-CreER(Tm) mice
               showed impaired insulin secretion. To identify direct targets of

               essential for postnatal β-cell function, directly regulates Pdx1

  abstract  = "The pancreas represents an important organ that has not been
               comprehensively studied in many fields. To fill this gap, many
               models have been generated, and traditional models have shown
               good performance in addressing pancreatic-related diseases, but
               are increasingly struggling to keep up with the need for further
               research due to ethical issues, genetic heterogeneity and
               difficult clinical translation. The new era calls for new and
               more reliable research models. Therefore, organoids have been
               proposed as a novel model for the evaluation of
               pancreatic-related diseases such as pancreatic malignancy,
               diabetes, and pancreatic cystic fibrosis. Compared with common
               traditional models, including 2D cell culture and gene editing
               mice, organoids derived from living humans or mice cause minimal
               harm to the donor, raise fewer ethical concerns, and reasonably
               address the claims of heterogeneity, which allows for the further
               development of pathogenesis studies and clinical trial analysis.
               In this review, we analyse studies on the use of pancreatic
               organoids in research on pancreatic-related diseases, discuss the
               advantages and disadvantages, and hypothesize future trends.",

               directly linked to the interferon system, such as the ICE

               in addition to transcriptional regulation by interferons,
               cytokines, hormones and many other factors. This includes
               heterodimerisation with activators and repressors of
               transcription. These protein interactions modulate the
               transactivating capacity of IRF-1. By using a two-hybrid system,
               we demonstrate that IRF-1 forms homodimers in vivo. The
               homodimerization domain was determined to be located in the
               N-terminal part of IRF-1 which belongs to the DNA-binding domain.
               Since this sequence is highly conserved between members of the
               IRF-family, our observation raises the question of
               homodimerization of other IRFs through this domain.",

               underlying mechanisms of disease remains a challenge1-3. For some
               diseases, a successful strategy has been to look for cases in
               which multiple GWAS loci contain genes that act in the same
               biological pathway1-6. However, our knowledge of which genes act
               in which pathways is incomplete, particularly for
               cell-type-specific pathways or understudied genes. Here we
               introduce a method to connect GWAS variants to functions. This
               method links variants to genes using epigenomics data, links
               genes to pathways de novo using Perturb-seq and integrates these
               data to identify convergence of GWAS loci onto pathways. We apply
               this approach to study the role of endothelial cells in genetic
               risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), and discover 43 CAD GWAS
               signals that converge on the cerebral cavernous malformation
               (CCM) signalling pathway. Two regulators of this pathway, CCM2
               and TLNRD1, are each linked to a CAD risk variant, regulate other
               CAD risk genes and affect atheroprotective processes in
               endothelial cells. These results suggest a model whereby CAD risk
               is driven in part by the convergence of causal genes onto a
               particular transcriptional pathway in endothelial cells. They
               highlight shared genes between common and rare vascular diseases
               (CAD and CCM), and identify TLNRD1 as a new, previously
               uncharacterized member of the CCM signalling pathway. This
               approach will be widely useful for linking variants to functions
               for other common polygenic diseases.",

               predict motifs de novo from ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) data.
               Similar redundant motifs are compared using the weighted

              loci associated with glucose and insulin-related traits. We aimed
              to characterize 19 such loci using detailed measures of insulin
              processing, secretion, and sensitivity to help elucidate their
              role in regulation of glucose control, insulin secretion and/or
              action. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We investigated associations
              of loci identified by the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and
              Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) with circulating
              proinsulin, measures of insulin secretion and sensitivity from
              oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), euglycemic clamps, insulin
              suppression tests, or frequently sampled intravenous glucose
              tolerance tests in nondiabetic humans (n = 29,084). RESULTS The
              glucose-raising allele in MADD was associated with abnormal
              insulin processing (a dramatic effect on higher proinsulin levels,
              but no association with insulinogenic index) at extremely
              persuasive levels of statistical significance (P = 2.1 x 10(-71)).
              Defects in insulin processing and insulin secretion were seen in
              glucose-raising allele carriers at TCF7L2, SCL30A8, GIPR, and
              C2CD4B. Abnormalities in early insulin secretion were suggested in
              glucose-raising allele carriers at MTNR1B, GCK, FADS1, DGKB, and
              PROX1 (lower insulinogenic index; no association with proinsulin
              or insulin sensitivity). Two loci previously associated with
              fasting insulin (GCKR and IGF1) were associated with OGTT-derived
              insulin sensitivity indices in a consistent direction. CONCLUSIONS
              Genetic loci identified through their effect on hyperglycemia
              and/or hyperinsulinemia demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in
              associations with measures of insulin processing, secretion, and
              sensitivity. Our findings emphasize the importance of detailed
              physiological characterization of such loci for improved
              understanding of pathways associated with alterations in glucose

              Primed enhancers are enriched for signal-dependent TF motifs and

              pathogenesis of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Insulin, which is
              produced in β-cells, is a critical regulator of metabolism.
              Insulin is synthesized as preproinsulin and processed to
              proinsulin. Proinsulin is then converted to insulin and C-peptide
              and stored in secretary granules awaiting release on demand.
              Insulin synthesis is regulated at both the transcriptional and
              translational level. The cis-acting sequences within the 5'
              flanking region and trans-activators including paired box gene 6
              (PAX6), pancreatic and duodenal homeobox- 1(PDX-1), MafA, and
              β-2/Neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1) regulate insulin
              transcription, while the stability of preproinsulin mRNA and its
              untranslated regions control protein translation. Insulin
              secretion involves a sequence of events in β-cells that lead to
              fusion of secretory granules with the plasma membrane. Insulin is
              secreted primarily in response to glucose, while other nutrients
              such as free fatty acids and amino acids can augment
              glucose-induced insulin secretion. In addition, various hormones,

              is a metabolic hub in the body, connecting nutrient metabolism and

              islets of Langerhans is critical for the proper regulation of
              insulin secretion. Thus, rodent β-cells form a functional
              syncytium that integrates and propagates information encoded by
              secretagogues, producing a ``gain-of-function'' in hormone release
              through the generation of coordinated cell-cell activity. By
              contrast, human islets possess divergent topology, and this may
              have repercussions for the cell-cell communication pathways that
              mediate the population dynamics underlying the intraislet
              regulation of insulin secretion. This is pertinent for type 2
              diabetes mellitus pathogenesis, and its study in rodent models,
              because environmental and genetic factors may converge on these
              processes in a species-specific manner to precipitate the
              defective insulin secretion associated with glucose intolerance.
              The aim of the present minireview is therefore to discuss the
              structural and functional underpinnings that influence insulin
              secretion from human islets, and the possibility that
              dyscoordination between individual β-cells may play an important

               However, current tools do not predict RNA-seq expression profiles
               because of modeling challenges. Here, we introduce Borzoi, a
               model that learns to predict cell-type-specific and
               tissue-specific RNA-seq coverage from DNA sequence. Using
               statistics derived from Borzoi's predicted coverage, we isolate

               of regulation, including transcription, splicing and
               polyadenylation. Evaluated on quantitative trait loci, Borzoi is
               competitive with and often outperforms state-of-the-art models
               trained on individual regulatory functions. By applying
               attribution methods to the derived statistics, we extract

               experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
               the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
               has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential
               expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data.
               The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading,
               normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities
               of limma have been significantly expanded in two important
               directions. First, the package can now perform both differential
               expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing
               (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously
               restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as
               well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
               microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package
               is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression
               analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in
               terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order
               expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for
               biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This
               article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package,

               assume that all acquired RNAs are endogenous to cells. However,
               any cell-free RNAs contained within the input solution are also
               captured by these assays. This sequencing of cell-free RNA
               constitutes a background contamination that confounds the
               biological interpretation of single-cell transcriptomic data.
               RESULTS: We demonstrate that contamination from this ``soup'' of
               cell-free RNAs is ubiquitous, with experiment-specific variations
               in composition and magnitude. We present a method, SoupX, for
               quantifying the extent of the contamination and estimating
               ``background-corrected'' cell expression profiles that seamlessly
               integrate with existing downstream analysis tools. Applying this
               method to several datasets using multiple droplet sequencing

               SoupX, a tool for removing ambient RNA contamination from
               droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing experiments. This tool
               has broad applicability, and its application can improve the
               biological utility of existing and future datasets.",

              into a rich variety of locus-specific contact patterns. Cohesin
              and CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) are key regulators; perturbing the
              levels of either greatly disrupts genome-wide folding as assayed
              by chromosome conformation capture methods. Still, how a given DNA
              sequence encodes a particular locus-specific folding pattern
              remains unknown. Here we present a convolutional neural network,
              Akita, that accurately predicts genome folding from DNA sequence
              alone. Representations learned by Akita underscore the importance
              of an orientation-specific grammar for CTCF binding sites. Akita
              learns predictive nucleotide-level features of genome folding,
              revealing effects of nucleotides beyond the core CTCF motif. Once
              trained, Akita enables rapid in silico predictions. Accounting for
              this, we demonstrate how Akita can be used to perform in silico
              saturation mutagenesis, interpret eQTLs, make predictions for
              structural variants and probe species-specific genome folding.
              Collectively, these results enable decoding genome function from

               of Type 1 diabetes mellitus and in islet graft rejection. The
               β-cell destruction is partially mediated by cytokines, such as
               IL-1β (interleukin 1β), TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α) and IFN-γ
               (interferon γ). IL-1β and TNFα mediate activation of the
               transcription factor NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) pathway. Use of a
               degradation-resistant NF-κB protein inhibitor (ΔNIκBα),
               specifically expressed in β-cells, significantly reduced
               IL-1β+IFN-γ-induced apoptosis. Moreover, in vivo, it protected
               against multiple low-dose streptozocin-induced diabetes, with
               reduced intra-islet lymphocytic infiltration. Thus
               β-cell-specific activation of NF-κB is a key event in the
               progressive loss of β-cells in diabetes. Inhibition of this

               receive the same barcode, resulting in a hybrid transcriptome. In
               most experiments, multiplets account for several percent of

               multiplets from the data and building a nearest neighbor
               classifier. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we test
               Scrublet on several datasets that include independent knowledge
