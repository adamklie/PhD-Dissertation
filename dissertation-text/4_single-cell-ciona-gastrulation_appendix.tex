    \caption[Quality control of the \textit{Ciona} single-cell gastrulation atlas]{\textbf{A.} Distribution of number of gene counts per cell across all time points (4.5 hours post fertilization (hpf), 5.5 hpf, and 6.5 hpf) and all biological replicates. \textbf{B.} Scatterplot of the number of gene counts per cell versus the number of genes per cell across the entire gastrulation atlas. \textbf{C-D.} Histograms of the number of gene counts per cell (C) and the number of genes per cell (D) across the entire gastrulation atlas. \textbf{E-F.} UMAP visualizations of the single-cell gastrulation atlas colored by time point (E) and by Leiden clustering (F).
