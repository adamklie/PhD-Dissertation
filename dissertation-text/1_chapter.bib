               so far are designed to address a specific question on a fixed
               dataset and/or by a fixed model architecture. Here we present
               Janggu, a python library facilitates deep learning for genomics
               applications, aiming to ease data acquisition and model
               evaluation. Among its key features are special dataset objects,
               which form a unified and flexible data acquisition and
               pre-processing framework for genomics data that enables
               streamlining of future research applications through reusable
               components. Through a numpy-like interface, these dataset objects
               are directly compatible with popular deep learning libraries,
               including keras or pytorch. Janggu offers the possibility to
               visualize predictions as genomic tracks or by exporting them to
               the bigWig format as well as utilities for keras-based models. We
               illustrate the functionality of Janggu on several deep learning

               topologies for the task of predicting binding sites for the
               transcription factor JunD. Second, we demonstrate the framework
               on published models for predicting chromatin effects. Third, we

               DNase hypersensitivity, histone modifications and DNA sequence
               features. We improve the performance of these models due to a

               significantly reduce repetitive programming overhead for deep

              structure, as well as other protein structural features, has been
              standard practice since the 1990s. Using profiles in the input of
              such predictors, in place or in addition to the sequence itself,
              leads to significantly more accurate predictions. While profiles
              can enhance structural signals, their role remains somewhat
              surprising as proteins do not use profiles when folding in vivo.
              Furthermore, the same sequence-based redundancy reduction
              protocols initially derived to train and evaluate sequence-based
              predictors, have been applied to train and evaluate profile-based
              predictors. This can lead to unfair comparisons since profiles may
              facilitate the bleeding of information between training and test
              sets. Here we use the extensively studied problem of secondary
              structure prediction to better evaluate the role of profiles and
              show that: (1) high levels of profile similarity between training
              and test proteins are observed when using standard sequence-based
              redundancy protocols; (2) the gain in accuracy for profile-based
              predictors, over sequence-based predictors, strongly relies on
              these high levels of profile similarity between training and test
              proteins; and (3) the overall accuracy of a profile-based
              predictor on a given protein dataset provides a biased measure
              when trying to estimate the actual accuracy of the predictor, or
              when comparing it to other predictors. We show, however, that this
              bias can be mitigated by implementing a new protocol (EVALpro)

              function of the profile similarity between training and test
              proteins. Such a protocol not only allows for a fair comparison of
              the predictors on equally hard or easy examples, but also reduces
              the impact of choosing a given similarity cutoff when selecting
              test proteins. The EVALpro program is available in the SCRATCH

              binding protein partner, known as the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs).
              Unfortunately, the binding preferences for most RBPs are still not
              well characterized. Interdependencies between sequence and
              secondary structure specificities is challenging for both
              predicting RBP binding sites and accurate sequence and structure
              motifs detection. RESULTS: In this study, we propose a deep
              learning-based method, iDeepS, to simultaneously identify the
              binding sequence and structure motifs from RNA sequences using
              convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a bidirectional long
              short term memory network (BLSTM). We first perform one-hot
              encoding for both the sequence and predicted secondary structure,
              to enable subsequent convolution operations. To reveal the hidden
              binding knowledge from the observed sequences, the CNNs are
              applied to learn the abstract features. Considering the close
              relationship between sequence and predicted structures, we use the
              BLSTM to capture possible long range dependencies between binding
              sequence and structure motifs identified by the CNNs. Finally, the
              learned weighted representations are fed into a classification
              layer to predict the RBP binding sites. We evaluated iDeepS on
              verified RBP binding sites derived from large-scale representative
              CLIP-seq datasets. The results demonstrate that iDeepS can
              reliably predict the RBP binding sites on RNAs, and outperforms
              the state-of-the-art methods. An important advantage compared to
              other methods is that iDeepS can automatically extract both
              binding sequence and structure motifs, which will improve our
              understanding of the mechanisms of binding specificities of RBPs.
              CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the iDeepS method identifies the
              sequence and structure motifs to accurately predict RBP binding
              sites. iDeepS is available at https://github.com/xypan1232/iDeepS

              learned features are often visualized and interpreted by
              converting them to sequence logos; an information-based
              representation of the consensus nucleotide motif. The process to
              obtain such motifs, however, is done through post-training
              procedures which often discard the filter weights themselves and
              instead rely upon finding those sequences maximally correlated

  abstract = "Quantifying DNA properties is a challenging task in the broad
              field of human genomics. Since the vast majority of non-coding DNA
              is still poorly understood in terms of function, this task is
              particularly important to have enormous benefit for biology
              research. Various DNA sequences should have a great variety of
              representations, and specific functions may focus on corresponding
              features in the front part of learning model. Currently, however,
              for multi-class prediction of non-coding DNA regulatory functions,
              most powerful predictive models do not have appropriate feature
              extraction and selection approaches for specific functional
              effects, so that it is difficult to gain a better insight into
              their internal correlations. Hence, we design a category attention
              layer and category dense layer in order to select efficient
              features and distinguish different DNA functions. In this study,
              we propose a hybrid deep neural network method, called DeepATT,
              for identifying $919$ regulatory functions on nearly $5$ million
              DNA sequences. Our model has four built-in neural network
              constructions: convolution layer captures regulatory motifs,
              recurrent layer captures a regulatory grammar, category attention
              layer selects corresponding valid features for different functions
              and category dense layer classifies predictive labels with
              selected features of regulatory functions. Importantly, we compare
              our novel method, DeepATT, with existing outstanding prediction
              tools, DeepSEA and DanQ. DeepATT performs significantly better
              than other existing tools for identifying DNA functions, at least
              increasing $1.6\%$ area under precision recall. Furthermore, we
              can mine the important correlation among different DNA functions
              according to the category attention module. Moreover, our novel
              model can greatly reduce the number of parameters by the mechanism
              of attention and locally connected, on the basis of ensuring
              accuracy.",

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Deciphering the language of non-coding DNA is one of
              the fundamental problems in genome research. Gene regulatory code
              is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant
              semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often
              fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios. RESULTS: To
              address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained
              bidirectional encoder represen-tation, named DNABERT, to capture
              global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences
              based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared
              DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide
              regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use,
              accuracy, and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained
              transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art
              performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites, and
              transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using
              small task-specific labelled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct
              visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic
              relationship within input sequences for better interpretability
              and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and
              functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate
              that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily
              applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We
              anticipate that the pre-trained DNABERT model can be fined tuned

                   problematic. Concretely, the problem in the convergence proof
                   of AMSGrad is in handling the hyper-parameters, treating them

              161 cell clusters with distinct spatial locations and projection

              of its location and orientation drive cell-type specific
              expression of a gene or transgene. It has been a long-standing
              goal in the field to decode the regulatory logic of an enhancer
              and to understand the details of how spatiotemporal gene
              expression is encoded in an enhancer sequence. Recently, deep
              learning models have yielded unprecedented insight into the
              enhancer code, and well-trained models are reaching a level of
              understanding that may be close to complete. As a consequence, we
              hypothesized that deep learning models can be used to guide the
              directed design of synthetic, cell type specific enhancers, and
              that this process would allow for a detailed tracing of all
              enhancer features at nucleotide-level resolution. Here we
              implemented and compared three different design strategies, each
              built on a deep learning model: (1) directed sequence evolution;
              (2) directed iterative motif implanting; and (3) generative
              design. We evaluated the function of fully synthetic enhancers to
              specifically target Kenyon cells in the fruit fly brain using
              transgenic animals. We then exploited this concept further by
              creating “dual-code” enhancers that target two cell types, and
              minimal enhancers smaller than 50 base pairs that are fully
              functional. By examining the trajectories followed during state
              space searches towards functional enhancers, we could accurately
              define the enhancer code as the optimal strength, combination, and
              relative distance of TF activator motifs, and the absence of TF
              repressor motifs. Finally, we applied the same three strategies to
              successfully design human enhancers. In conclusion, enhancer
              design guided by deep learning leads to better understanding of
              how enhancers work and shows that their code can be exploited to

              manner, making it a challenge to extract learned features that are
              biologically meaningful, such as sequence motifs. Here we perform
              a comprehensive analysis on synthetic sequences to investigate the
              role that CNN activations have on model interpretability. We show
              that employing an exponential activation to first layer filters
              consistently leads to interpretable and robust representations of
              motifs compared to other commonly used activations. Strikingly, we
              demonstrate that CNNs with better test performance do not
              necessarily imply more interpretable representations with
              attribution methods. We find that CNNs with exponential
              activations significantly improve the efficacy of recovering
              biologically meaningful representations with attribution methods.
              We demonstrate these results generalise to real DNA sequences
              across several in vivo datasets. Together, this work demonstrates
              how a small modification to existing CNNs, i.e. setting
              exponential activations in the first layer, can significantly
              improve the robustness and interpretabilty of learned
              representations directly in convolutional filters and indirectly
              with attribution methods.",

              perform exceptionally well in a variety of tasks, including
              biological sequence classification. Available implementations,

              to reuse. To enable researchers to utilize these networks more
              easily, we implemented pysster, a Python package for training CNNs
              on biological sequence data. Sequences are classified by learning
              sequence and structure motifs and the package offers an automated
              hyper-parameter optimization procedure and options to visualize
              learned motifs along with information about their positional and
              class enrichment. The package runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU and
              provides a simple interface to train and evaluate a network with a
              handful lines of code. Using an RNA A-to-I editing dataset and
              cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP)-seq binding site

              sequence analysis to evaluate the statistical significance of a
              biological sequence. In many cases, biologists need sophisticated
              shuffling tools that preserve not only the counts of distinct
              letters but also higher-order statistics such as doublet counts,
              triplet counts, and, in general, k-let counts. RESULTS: We present
              a sequence analysis tool (named uShuffle) for generating uniform
              random permutations of biological sequences (such as DNAs, RNAs,
              and proteins) that preserve the exact k-let counts. The uShuffle
              tool implements the latest variant of the Euler algorithm and uses
              Wilson's algorithm in the crucial step of arborescence generation.
              It is carefully engineered and extremely efficient. The uShuffle
              tool achieves maximum flexibility by allowing arbitrary alphabet
              size and let size. It can be used as a command-line program, a web

              characterize this relationship. We present MPRA-DragoNN, a

              interpret the regulatory activity of DNA sequences as measured by

              regulatory regions in human K562 and HepG2 cell lines.
              MPRA-DragoNN predictions were moderately correlated (Spearman ρ =

              This task is particularly difficult for non-coding DNA, the vast

              A powerful predictive model for the function of non-coding DNA can
              have enormous benefit for both basic science and translational

              learning for Genomics. Even though Deep Learning methods such as
              Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks
              (RNNs) are becoming widespread in Genomics, developing and
              training such models is outside the ability of most researchers in
              the field. RESULTS: Here we present ENNGene-Easy Neural Network
              model building tool for Genomics. This tool simplifies training of
              custom CNN or hybrid CNN-RNN models on genomic data via an
              easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. ENNGene allows multiple
              input branches, including sequence, evolutionary conservation, and
              secondary structure, and performs all the necessary preprocessing
              steps, allowing simple input such as genomic coordinates. The
              network architecture is selected and fully customized by the user,
              from the number and types of the layers to each layer's precise
              set-up. ENNGene then deals with all steps of training and
              evaluation of the model, exporting valuable metrics such as
              multi-class ROC and precision-recall curve plots or TensorBoard
              log files. To facilitate interpretation of the predicted results,
              we deploy Integrated Gradients, providing the user with a
              graphical representation of an attribution level of each input
              position. To showcase the usage of ENNGene, we train multiple
              models on the RBP24 dataset, quickly reaching the state of the art
              while improving the performance on more than half of the proteins
              by including the evolutionary conservation score and tuning the
              network per protein. CONCLUSIONS: As the role of DL in big data
              analysis in the near future is indisputable, it is important to
              make it available for a broader range of researchers. We believe
              that an easy-to-use tool such as ENNGene can allow Genomics
              researchers without a background in Computational Sciences to
              harness the power of DL to gain better insights into and extract

                   the lack of a common foundational goal among methods. For

                   approximation, some by game theoretic notions, and some by
                   obtaining clean visualizations. This fragmentation of goals

                   these challenges by unifying eight popular post hoc
                   explanation methods (LIME, C-LIME, KernelSHAP, Occlusion,
                   Vanilla Gradients, Gradients x Input, SmoothGrad, and

                   local function approximation of the black-box model,
                   differing only in the neighbourhood and loss function used to
                   perform the approximation. This unification enables us to (1)
