## Abstract

## My Dissertation Writing Workflow

This dissertation document was generated with [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/), a typesetting program that is commonly used across multiple academic disciplines. 

### Downloading the LaTeX Typesetting Software

As I am working in MacOS, I used the [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) distribution, but you can download the versions for Linux and Windows ([TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) for both systems, or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) for Windows). There are also online versions of LaTeX, such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), that are easily accessible!

### Software for Compiling the Dissertation Document

I wrote the text for my dissertation in Google Docs to make things easily accessible for my committee, then I would export the text to edit the `.tex` files for each chapter in [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

I also used the following tools to make the writing process easier:

* [**LaTeX Language Support for Visual Studio Code**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mathematic.vscode-latex)
* [**LaTeX Workshop** Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)
* [**Better BibTeX** for the Zotero Reference Manager](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/)
* [**Zotero LaTeX** Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bnavetta.zoterolatex)

> [!TIP]
> I wrote my dissertation in 2022 and since then, there have been updates to various reference managers (such as [PaperPile](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=paperpile.com)) that allow for efficient exporting of documents with embedded references to the `.tex` format!
>
> There have also been updates to the dissertation requirements, so always remember to the Division of Graduate Education and Postdoctoral Affairs website on ["Dissertation and Thesis Submission"](https://grad.ucsd.edu/academics/preparing-to-graduate/dissertation-thesis-submission.html) to make sure you're following university guidelines.
